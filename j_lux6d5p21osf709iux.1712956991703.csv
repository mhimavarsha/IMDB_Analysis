The performances of all the actors, female or male, are also did great jobs. Pay attention to the guy who played with the plant leaves, broken it, then sneakly turned the vase around a little bit to hide the broken leaf, that scene, well, was so good.

This movie can be enjoyed by adult audiences or with parental discretion and it would be wise to note that obscene language is present throughout the film. The second installation in the PAYDAY trilogy though rated R tends to have veered away from the use of shock factor and focuses on developing a cohesive storyline. This time around we are offered a fascinating glimpse into the religious impact on Barbadian life. &quot;Next Payday&quot; is based on the perceived acceptance of the illegal drug trade, community life, and faith or lack thereof as part of its characters&#39; lives. The film, written by Shakirah Bourne, makes fun of those realities while highlighting the need for individuals to think critically.&quot;Next Payday,&quot; which opened on Wednesday 15th at The Olympus Cinema, boasts of a beautiful soundtrack. Bajans In Motion Inc assembles a great group of songs, from hip-hop to sweet gospel classics featuring the creme DE la creme in the local music industry. The theme song &quot;I&#39;m Gonna Get Paid&quot; sung by Marisa Lindsay and the ever talented Adaeze is one which if marketed well can catapult them into the American mainstream contemporary gospel arena. The song has catchy lyrics with an amazing hook and the production on the song is impeccable! The guest appearance by Toni Norville in the film was over-the top and forgettable which is quite ironic. She performed directly to the camera and appeared disconnected and unaware of her purpose. We all know that music is the driving force of action and in this film it was used to communicate a sense of place, as well as to get laughs. The Bajan term &quot;wuk up&quot; which is a dance locals do to calypso was highlighted through the hilarious chorus &quot;Wuk-Up &amp; get on bad! Pooch back for Jesus! Wuk-up &amp; Get on bad!&quot; during a church scene. There is always great debate on the influence of secular music in the church and how it can impact on the congregation but one gets the sense that in Barbadian society as long as something is done in Jesus name it is alright.right?&quot;Next Payday&quot; contains an impressive amount of energy considering that it&#39;s the second installment in the Payday Trilogy. Yet although most of the &quot;Payday&quot; team returns, the inclusion of Joyann Skeete, Hilana Layne, Carla Springer-Hunte, Patrick Foster, Jherad Alleyne and George Gill were welcome additions. Dyestra Browne who played Romie&#39;s father is NOT BACK instead he was replaced by George Gill. Gill has an intense presence on screen and his chemistry with Sandra Sealy (Romie&#39;s mom) was so natural it seems as though they were married in real life. It would be difficult to single out any weak actors because they all were exceptionally good; however, I am sure that viewers will have a great appreciation for the actors who played the characters &quot;Flintstone, Patrice, Deborah and Brother Martin.&quot;2014 was a win-win for Bajans In Motion Inc industry with both critically acclaimed movies (&quot;PAYDAY&quot; and &quot;TWO SMART&quot;). Though this company has self-funded all of their films so far they are blazing a path for others to follow. Barbados has gotten the message that there are a group of young professionals whose mission is to produce movies which capture Barbadian life and culture and many cultural supporters will be looking forward to many more movies from this company which tells our stories in the most candid way.","Romie and Pack miss the deadline to pay the balance of the money for the garage due o the government taxes and other regulations.

Using the end of the pier show to hold together its interweaved biographical stories, it provides an emotional, sometimes weird survey of the politics of leaving the EU, spliced together with the production of a summertime special.Set during those stormy intemperate years within the Conservative Party, we see the meteoric rise of the populist Right. But far from being laden with dreary depictions of those now long-forgotten (or bitterly remembered) conflicts around Brexit, it shows how ordinary people in a far from ordinary location simply manage to get on and get by.You could perhaps take away from the documentary a sense of social fracture, but you would be wrong, it is filled with love. From a heartbroken lead singer hoping to be recalled for another season, to the character of John Lee - an arch-Brexiteer and local fisherman who dreams of independence but reflects that he is the last of his line; no one in his family wishes to continue in the fishing business.Some of the cast are my friends, many are acquaintances and, poignantly, two of the cast have since sadly died. Their ghosts stay with you. But so too do those who leave North Norfolk to make a new life in Europe. Leaving a strange mix of hope and sorrow for those of us who watched this, the ones left behind, seated (when I watched it) in the very theatre it was filmed in. It is also laugh out loud funny.In the end though, this wonderful film is about the jobbing end of show business, love, unity, and the things that bind us together, and it points to several possible futures for its cast and for those watching - it will be up to us which path we choose now the storm has passed over.","Seaside Special follows the town of Cromer on the north Norfolk coast as it prepares for its annual end of pier variety show, a burlesque mix of song and dance, standup comedy and slapstick performed twice a day for three months, in the summer of 2019, set against the tumultuous backdrop of clashing views within the community over Brexit. —leefieSeaside Special follows the town of Cromer on the north Norfolk coast as it prepares for its annual end of pier variety show, a burlesque mix of song and dance, standup comedy and slapstick performed twice a day for three months, in the summer of 2019, set against the tumultuous backdrop of clashing views within the community over Brexit. —leefie","€900,000.00"

released to the United States as the Three and a half Musketeers.I first saw this 12 years ago on the Nostalgia Channel.It hasn&#39;t been released on video yet.This is a spoof of The Three Musketeers.It follows the first half of the Alexandre Dumas novel with D&#39;Artagnan&#39;s first encounters with the Three Musketeers and saving the Queen&#39;s honor from Cardinal Richelieu and his agents Rochefort and Milady de Winter.In this version D&#39;Artagnan is also a master of disguise.He disguises himself as Constance and Cardinal Richelieu in different scenes and not very good but good enough to fool the Cardinal&#39;s agents.If you liked the Ritz Brothers version or the 1942 Cantinflas version.You will like this one.Constance is played by Rosa Arenas(also known as Rosita Arenas) veteran actress of Mexican horror films and Milady de Winter is played by Martha Valdes an attractive auburn haired Janet Leigh look-a-like.The actor playing Rochefort does a great job.A sinister looking individual with a patch over his eye and a long scar on the cheek.I can see where he was model for the Rochefort character in other remakes.The sets and costumes resemble the Gene Kelly 1948 version.The Mexican film locations were beautiful reminds one of Normandy,France.This was my favorite of the comical versions of Three Musketeers.I have alot of older Hispanic friends who really enjoyed this version being they grew up with the comedy of Tin Tan and Cantinflas.A must see for those loving spoofs of the classics.","An intelligent dog helps the Three Musketeers.An

I can&#39;t believe this film was marketed as a horror in th UK! This is terrible as it&#39;s actually a comedy drama! I thought it was a horror as the whole DVD was in the style of a horror film and the summary even made it sound like one, the title was also different (Awaken The Night) I don&#39;t know where they got that title from. On the UK DVD cover it has Nikki Reed and DJ Qualls faces above a dark creepy forest, where a woman (supposedly Nikki Reed&#39;s character) is running away from a man (supposedly DJ Qualls character) and theirs even splatters of blood on the woman and blood on 2 of the trees. I think the UK marketing for this film is unacceptable because this movie definitely isn&#39;t a horror and theirs not even a forest or blood in it.But, the film was actually very good, although it wasn&#39;t anything like I expected it to be. The acting was brilliant, the style was very modern and real, and over all the film was very good. I would probably give the film 6/10 overall but I would give the UK marketing for it no stars as it is just unbelievably stupid.","This unpredictable story follows an agitated fast-food employee, Joe, who's reached his breaking point from being harassed and tormented by his boss.

Of course, five tedious, unattractive XXX scenes break up his string of unfunny one-liners.He tries to be hip, referring to Milton Berle as &quot;Merle&quot;, and somehow thinking he&#39;s competitive with a Henny Youngman. Including the bad jokes, the script by Anthony&#39;s son Mitch Spinelli is beyond lousy. Add to that gimmicky, terrible editing throughout.Set in a tiny, dingy night club owned by Buck Adams, the movie is relentlessly downbeat (including a terrible jazz score by Faux Pas). Except for cute (and innocent looking) cigarette girl Alice Springs, every character is unsympathetic and overall the mood, if not the content, suggests a low-rent version of the classic story &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; by Maxim Gorky, so brilliantly filmed by geniuses Kurosawa and Renoir.So we get to see star Zara Whites completely wasted in a non-role working for Adams, and having sex scenes with Adams and Marc Wallice; while Trixy Tyler is an audience member Silvera deigns to f*ck backstage. In the 1970s when porn was a theatrical experience, this movie would have fallen into the &quot;chaser&quot; category, shown in rotation to encourage a deadbeat audience to leave the fleapit theater rather than sit there all night (or all day) -it&#39;s that bad.","",""

On his 40th birthday he begins to look back on his life and realizes it was fully of misery and the only place to reach happiness is when he&#39;s asleep and dreaming. Fans of Mulloy should find enough humor in this short to make it worth viewing. As I&#39;ve often said, Mulloy&#39;s style of animation might appear crude but it&#39;s actually very fitting to the subject matter and you really do feel as if it weren&#39;t for the movies looking like this then even the best wouldn&#39;t have worked so well. What I enjoyed most about this film is how Mulloy gets his message across about the commandment without having to be preachy or put it out there in big bold letters. I won&#39;t spoil the message or how it&#39;s given but it was handled very nicely and it will certainly leave a smirk on your face. The highlight has to be the dream sequence when both parties reveal what they really want to do with their lives but never do it. I&#39;m sure those easily offended might object to some of the humor but fans of Mulloy should enjoy it.","",""

Thankfully, Lamas is kind enough in this case to share the spotlight with two women, Kathleen Kinmont (the heroine) and Lori Fetrick (the villainess), who both have superb bodies: sweaty, muscular and fit. They even have two fights against each other, and even though Fetrick has an obvious strength advantage, Kinmont holds her own pretty well.

Director Katja Esson truly demonstrated her remarkable talent in bringing to light the struggles faced by the Liberty City residents in their fight against climate gentrification.The documentary skillfully delved into the lives of those residing eight miles inland from Miami&#39;s picturesque beaches, as they bravely fought to preserve their beloved community. Set against the backdrop of a ridge that transformed into real estate gold, Esson masterfully captured the essence of their struggle, making it a poignant and thought-provoking experience for the audience.The premier at Coral Gables Art Cinema was nothing short of a cinematic celebration. The inclusion of live poetry readings and music added a layer of beauty and emotion to the event, complementing the narrative in a way that enhanced the overall viewing experience. It was a delightful surprise that elevated the evening to an unforgettable level.What truly stood out was the insightful panel discussion that followed the screening. Bringing together various stakeholders, including tenants from the movie, community activists, and developers, the panel offered a well-rounded perspective on the issues raised in the documentary. It was fascinating to witness a diverse range of voices coming together to engage in a meaningful dialogue about the challenges faced by the Liberty City community.In the end, the premier of &quot;Razing Liberty Square&quot; was not just a film screening; it was a complete and immersive experience. The combination of breathtaking visuals, live performances, and a thought-provoking panel discussion made it a night to remember. Kudos to Katja Esson and the entire team for creating a documentary that not only informs but also inspires change. I left the cinema with a renewed sense of awareness and a deep appreciation for the resilience of communities fighting for their homes.","Eight miles inland of Miami's beaches, Liberty City residents fight to save their community from climate gentrification: their land, sitting on a ridge, becomes real estate gold.Eight miles inland of Miami's beaches, Liberty City residents fight to save their community from climate gentrification: their land, sitting on a ridge, becomes real estate gold.","$900,000.00"

His first and, I&#39;ll venture, his only strictly dramatic feature, the film traces the romantic dilemma of a young French woman living in Paris. It was Chaplin&#39;s first film with United Artists  which he had founded in 1919 with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith. Originally entitled &#39;Public Opinion&#39; and then &#39;Destiny,&#39; Chaplin considered a dozen more titles before he finally settled on a name.Marie St. Clair (Edna Purviance) and her romance Jean Millet (Clarence Geldart), an aspiring artist, residents of a small French village, have plans to move to Paris and get married. However, unfortunate circumstances delay their plans, and Marie impulsively boards the train without Jean. A year or so later, Marie has assimilated into the upper-class lifestyle of Paris, having become the mistress of a wealthy, cynical businessman, Pierre Revel (Adolphe Menjou). It is then that she and Jean suddenly meet again. Though there are undoubtedly still feelings between them, Marie must decide whether she can sacrifice all of Pierre&#39;s luxuries to pursue the man that she loves.Written, produced and directed by Chaplin, &#39;A Woman of Paris&#39; is a tightly-paced drama/romance, employing a lot of dialogue (somewhat unusual for Chaplin, who usually relied on extended slapstick comedic set pieces to drive his silent films) and a three-way relationship that has since become commonplace in films of this sort. The film allowed Chaplin to extend his skills beyond the realm of the lovable little Tramp. Unfortunately, this seemingly was not what audiences wanted. Perhaps perceived as a harmful satire of the American way of life, &#39;A Woman of Paris&#39; was banned in several US states on the grounds of immorality, and it was a commercial flop. Chaplin had conceived the film as a means of launching the individual acting career of Edna Purviance, though this bid was unsuccessful. It did, however, make an international star of Adolphe Menjou.Many critics, despite the poor box office performance, praised the film&#39;s startling realism. Notably, director Michael Powell (&#39;Black Narcissus,&#39; &#39;Peeping Tom&#39;) cited &#39;A Woman of Paris&#39; as his greatest inspiration to become a filmmaker. In 1976, a frail Charles Chaplin  just one year before his death  reissued the edited film with a new musical score he had composed, aided by music arranger Eric James. A criminally underrated silent classic, &#39;A Woman of Paris&#39; is yet another testament to Chaplin&#39;s undeniable cinematic genius.","Believing that she has been jilted by her artist fiance' Jean when he fails to meet her at the railway station, Marie St. Clair goes off to Paris alone.

King Ghidrah makes his second appearance, and it is a lot more fun and interesting than his first (&quot;Ghidrah The Three Headed Monster&quot; from 1964).This definitely isn&#39;t the fastest moving Godzilla film, but there are a lot of cool things to look at as the plot goes along slow at times. And the alien invasion/takeover plot is pretty decent if not overly original. The aliens look pretty cool and their hardware is 60&#39;s sci-fi retro, you gotta love it.Nick Adams is pretty decent enough and gives the film a certain flair. It&#39;s a shame he had to leave us so soon, as it would have been a blast to have him return in a future Godzilla film.The special effects are totally mid-60&#39;s Godzilla, with all the obvious miniatures being stomped on by the guys in the monster suits. There&#39;s one great shot where a doll of an astronaut gets lowered onto Planet X via an open elevator outside the spaceship, and as the doll is lowered to the ground in one lengthy camera shot, you can&#39;t help but laugh a little realizing that there was no attempt whatsoever to make that shot look real, or to hide the fact it&#39;s so fake with quick silly editing. But that&#39;s part of the charm of the early Godzilla films. I always thought it was odd when, on Planet X underground, as the leader shows the astronauts the screen showing Ghidrah wildly attacking on the surface, that Ghidrah is in essence attacking nothing but rocks and dirt because that&#39;s all there is on the planet&#39;s surface. And also how Ghidrah flies past that huge painting of a planet in the distance a few times.Godzilla and Rodan eventually save the Earth and that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about in a 1965 Godzilla film. Godzilla by this time was definitely all hero protecting his home planet. It&#39;s such a shame that unless a movie looks like a silly music video, so many kids won&#39;t watch it. Hopefully a lot of parents are introducing their kids to these old Godzilla films via DVD and video, because they sure aren&#39;t on TV much anymore.","Astronauts Glenn and Fuji are sent to investigate Planet X, a newly discovered planet located just beyond Jupiter.

One, the old vehicles and planes. Two, the street scenes of Los Angeles and a couple of scenes from football games in a bygone era.The story is silly, never in the least convincing. The action is way, way over the top; Grange et al. flail clumsily at each other in every chapter, sometimes several times. And all sorts of horrible things happen to Grange, without him having a smudge on his suit, a scratch on his face, or even a sore knuckle from fighting. The dialog is so stiff that I winced several times. And worst of all is the acting, if it can be called that. Grange was a great football player, by all accounts, for the University of Illinois and in the NFL, but he couldn&#39;t act his way out of a paper bag. He and Babe Ruth, another poor actor in movies, should have stuck with sport.The segues between episodes are narrated, rather than written as in most other serials. And are these segues bad! They begin each chapter after the first. Each episode ends with a villainous laugh by a man who is described as a &quot;cripple.&quot; That was actually rather good.This doesn&#39;t leave us with much--except the old cars, planes, trolleys, and the long ago street scenes.","A gambling ring run out of the Mogul Taxi company is intent on fixing college football games.

Most Artist Linger in Semi-Obscurity even if They have Attained a Modicum of Money, Fame, or Admiration and Recognition. A Good Bit of the Time there are Splashes in the Public Eye, but Unless the Work is in a Sort of Popular Culture Saturation, it is Unlikely that Any given Artist, Outside the Bubble of a Particular Field, Comic Books, for Example, a Particular Artist Remains Relatively Unknown.Documentaries can Flesh Out the Person Behind the Art, at Least a Little bit, and can Shed Some Insight and Light while giving a Platform for the Art to be Exposed in Heaps for Ninety Minutes or so. Aside, from a Coffee Table Book that Includes Pages and Pages of Artwork, a Docu-Film will most Likely be Seen by More People than Buy the Book.So here is Ralph Steadman. Who, You Say? Exactly. Unless You were a Reader of Rolling Stone Magazine in the Seventies, or a Fan of Gonzo Journalist Hunter S. Thompson, Steadman has Remained in the Aforementioned Obscurity. But that&#39;s About the Extent of His Explosion of Exposure.Not that it is Insignificant, much to the Contrary, He and the Good Doctor, Thompson, Defined Gonzo Journalism, and Tried to &quot;Change the world!&quot;, a Phrase that Steadman Utters at Least Three Times in the Documentary and in the End, at Age 76, Seems Disappointed that Most of what He Tried to Change, Remains Unchanged.The Fancy Film from Director Charlie Paul is Filled with enough Interesting Anecdotes and Surprisingly Rare and Old Archival Footage, a lot with Hunter. It also Includes Interviews with Other Folks who have Worked with Steadman and it is all Anchored with Johnny Depp, Long Time Friend and Fan. Terry Gilliam&#39;s Movie, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998) is Based on the Book by Thompson that Included Illustrations by Steadman and may be the Artist Link to Moderns with the Most Resonance. Overall, a Must See Movie for Lovers of Art, the Sixties Counter Culture, Hunter S. Thompson, and to Get an Introduction to One of the Most Bizarre and Powerful Political Artists of Our Time. His Work and Some of His Unique Mystique and Technique, Much on Display Here, can be Admired and Studied.","Johnny Depp pays a visit to Ralph Steadman, the renown artist and the last of the original Gonzo visionaries who worked alongside Hunter S.

I knew nothing at all about the film and went somewhat apprehensively. I needn&#39;t have worried however as it was a fantastic film.It follows four young girls who leave their Aboriginal community in the hope of entertaining US troops in Vietnam and becoming big stars. That&#39;s all it does. The director doesn&#39;t try to overplay it and make it overly dramatic. Instead it feels somewhat like a documentary, with no clear path as to where it&#39;s going.The actresses playing the four girls were superb, all being fantastic actresses who are believable in their work, but also incredible singers. Jessica Mauboy in particular was amazing and I honestly could have listened to them all night, no dialogue needed. Chris O&#39;Dowd, the manager of the band, is funny while being endearing. The director subtly brought romance into the plot without taking anything away from the main story.Racism was a key topic that was brought up regularly to show how Aboriginal people were treated in the community and all the characters have to deal with it in some form of another. Kay in particular has to decide between being a white or black girl. It also brings home how prevalent it was then with one white solider refusing to be treated by a black doctor. It was truly harrowing.The film was shot wonderfully, with the Aboriginal community lit up in beautiful sunshine, while Vietnam scenes were kept bleak and grey.A great film that I would watch again.","1968 was the year that changed the world. And for four young Aboriginal sisters from a remote mission it was the year that would change their lives forever. Around the globe, there was protest and revolution in the streets. Indigenous Australians finally secured the right to vote. There were drugs and the shock of a brutal assassination. And there was Vietnam. The sisters--Cynthia, Gail, Julie, and Kay--are discovered by Dave, a very kind-hearted talent scout with very little rhythm but a great knowledge of soul music. Billed as Australia's answer to The Supremes, Dave secures the sisters their first true gig and flies them to Vietnam to sing for the American troops. Based on a true story, ""The Sapphires"" is a triumphant celebration of youthful emotion, family, and music. —Goalpost Pictures1968 was the year that changed the world.

In the last minute of the game he has no choice and marks a penalty . Unfailing honesty makes him worthy of an attempted lynching for whistling a penalty in a match that means the elimination of the Spanish team from the World Cup. His only chance of escape is San Amancio, a small town on the Galician coast . He hides in the village of his father Pellejo (Ramón Barea) which he hasn&#39;t visited since his childhood and whose inhabitants are dedicated exclusively to the smuggling of &quot;Liquor del santo&quot;. Alli Pellejo sees the arrival of his son as the opportunity to assert himself before his countrymen . He manages to get the Line Judge to be taken as a true Judge , but then Matías&#39;s problems have only just begun. The villagers have belief that he can put them all in jail for smuggling &quot;Liquor del Santo&quot;, means of subsistence for all the people . Smuggling is carried out through coffins. The &quot;Licor del Santo&quot; is taken from the ship to the church in coffins to later distribute it through other churches in the country. The locals gathered as many bottles as they could, before the proper authorities arrive . But two Civil Guardias stand in their way .Outlandish feature second film by two good screenwriters , Luis Gudiri and Santiago Aguilar , nicknamed ¨La Cuadrilla¨ , here they make a fun comedy with northern habits , smuggling , confusion and mayhem . It blends comedy , slight drama , rural conventionality , social habits , criticism and ¨Esperpento¨. Made in budget enough and in brilliant colour and a peculiar plot following the Spanish tradition . It is a piece of absurdity and nonsense , full of comical as well as attractive situations . Directors Santiago Aguilar, Luis Guridi , the two components of the ¨Cuadrilla¨, subsequent screenwriters of the successful ¨Cámara Café¨ series , here directing their second feature film belonging to what they called the trilogy of ¨España Por La Puerta De atrás¨ formed by ¨Justino , Un asesino de la Tercera Edad¨, ¨Matias , Juez de Linea ¨and ¨Atilano Presidente¨. A look at the most grotesque Spain in the vein of classic maestro Luís Garcia Berlanga, without forgetting the references to comedies such as &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; from the famous British Ealing factory. A simple and plain script starred by the offbeat and geeky Matias , a self-destructive referee who whistles a clear penalty at the last minute in favor of Finland which gives victory to the Finns and the Spanish fans cry out for revenge , it forces Matías to flee to the little town where his father still lives . There are some very amusing scenes such as two of the villagers, before the arrival of a larger shipment, expel a dead man from his habitat , the coffin , in order to have more room to carry the liquor , something similar to what Peter Lorre and Vincent Price did in The Comedy of Terrors ( 1964) by Jacques Tourneur . As this ¨Matias Juez de linea¨ takes ideas from other films as the British ¨Captain Clegg¨ (La Patrulla Fantasma-1962) de Peter Graham Scott , ¨Whiskey Galore !¨ (1949) by Alexander Mackendrick that was remade as ¨Whiskey Galore !¨(2016) by Gillies MacKinnon and ¨Comedy of Terrors¨. Main and support cast are pretty good . Stars the unknown Carlos de Gabriel who plays competently El juez de línea Matías , a soccer referee who&#39;s promised his dying mother never to lie and costars Ramón Barea as his always drunk father . Along with a lot of sympathetic characters played by familar faces , such as ¨Manuel Manquiña as peculiar priest Don Aurelio , Alicia Sánchez as &#39;La Patrona&#39; , Álex Angulo , Antonio Durán &#39;Morris&#39; , Charly Bravo , Marta Fernández Muro , Enrique Villén , Fernando Vivanco , Saturnino García who starred ¨Justino¨ and brief cameo by Santiago Segura.It contains colorful and evocative cinematography by great cinematographer Flavio Martínez Labiano , considered to be one of the best Spanish cameramen , he photographed successes as &quot;The Day of the Beast&quot; , ¨800 bullets¨ , &quot;Timecrimes&quot; and subsequently working in Hollywood , including box-office movies as ¨Bones¨ , ¨Non-stop¨ , ¨Unknown¨ , ¨The gunman¨ and ¨Shallows¨. Being filmed on location in Lugo , Galicia, Picón, A Coruña, Ortigueira, A Coruña, Galicia, and Madrid . Likewise , a charming and catching soundtrack by José Carlos Mac , including Galician music . This offbeat motion picture was decent though strangely directed by Luis Gudiri and Santiago Aguilar in budget enough , while their first one , ¨Justino¨being financed by crowdfunding and an amount of money delivered by Canal Plus . Rating : 6/10 . Acceptable and passable . Well worth watching for Spanish cinema buffs ,","Matias is a soccer referee. He promised his dying mother never to lie.

But guess having a relatively known name like hers in the movie and flaunting it that way is the way to lure people in.As for the story told in &quot;Devils Ground&quot;, then I thought it was actually good, and the plot managed to keep me hanging and wanting to see what would happen next. And there was a nice twist of storyline towards the end, and I for one, hadn&#39;t anticipated the story to take a turn like that. But it was a nice surprise nonetheless.The cast in the movie was actually decent. I like Leah Gibsons portrayal of the role of Amy Singer, she was doing a good job with her character. And as usual, to me at least, it is always nice to see Daryl Hannah in a movie, I find her charismatic in a way. And Daniel Probert, in the role of Billy, was also really well cast, and he brought a lot of color to that role, and he played it quite well. I think it was somewhat of a shame that Twan Holliday&#39;s character Jimmy wasn&#39;t given more screen time than he had, because his character could have added a lot to the story. And Twan Holliday has a really distinct voice.For a slasher movie, &quot;Devils Ground&quot; doesn&#39;t offer lots of blood and gore, but it has just enough killing to make it interesting. There was just the right amount of blood and mayhem to keep you lured in, so that worked well enough. However, being a slasher movie, I don&#39;t think that &quot;Devils Ground&quot; has enough impact to make a lasting impression, unless you are a fan of someone in the movie. It just lacks something to make it stand out, unfortunately. Then again, it has a really nice surprise twist to it, which many other slasher movies lacks.I like horror movies, and I personally think that &quot;Devils Ground&quot; was actually a good enough entry to the horror genre, just a shame that it failed to leave a lasting impression.","While traveling from California to Bangor through a lonely road, Carrie Mitchel is advised by the gas station attendant Jimmy to rest in a hotel; however, she decides to continue driving through the night.

However, when I see this film, as well as the Tyrone Power version of THE SUN ALSO RISES, I am left wondering if the problem with Hollywood adaptations of his work was that they were TOO faithful.  That&#39;s right, all you Hemingway lovers: too faithful.  The man&#39;s dialog works on paper, but when spoken by the actors--good actors at that--it becomes downright silly. 
Hemingway once wrote a play, THE FIFTH COLUMN, that was snickered by theatre-goers in 1937.  He learned his lesson and never wrote another play. Some of the Hollywood scriptwriters might have also learned, if not from the reviews of THE FIFTH COLUMN, at least from the film of THE KILLERS: the best way to adapt Hemingway is to steer away from his dialog, not stick so close to it.
That said, I must confess I enjoy this film like the others...though I can&#39;t help but chuckle at it sometimes.","Spain in the 1930s is the place to be for a man of action like Robert Jordan.

Fascinating story of two New York City hustlers who meet by chance while selling their bodies in the street. Harry Reems and Darby Lloyd Rains are the two jaded hustlers who realize they are two of a kind, and together they build a kind &quot;sex empire,&quot; a high end escort service that caters to clients with extreme and bizzare sexual kinks. Never before in the history of adult cinema has hardcore sex been combined more seamlessly with an always fascinating story, while at the same time delivering comedy that is funny and intelligent. Add into the mix some truly beautiful sex scenes that are graphic, but never raunchy or ugly, and you basically have the perfect adult film. The look of &quot;Every Inch A Lady&quot; is impressive as well: it might be the professional lighting or the appealing sets, but the movie possesses this beautiful, vintage, golden hue that makes everything seem to glow. Yes, this is seminal 1970s stuff, as well as one of the best vintage New York City movies of all time. NY is portrayed as a giant, swinging playground, filled with eccentric characters and eye popping fashion. While watching something like this it&#39;s hard not to wonder if things were really that much fun back then. Of course things turn serious during the last half hour, which is totally unexpected, but it fits perfectly with the first hour. This is required viewing for fans of Harry Reems as well, as this is among his absolute finest, up there with &quot;Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Sometimes Sweet Susan...&quot; a genre masterpiece.","Chino and Crystal are a couple who run their own escort service.

Rourke&#39;s character Rudy is a supposed &quot;Karate Master&quot; but when he does a roundhouse kick to a guy it first cuts to the foot then jaggedly cuts to Rourke killing him. This is Rourke&#39;s monotone years, where you need subtitles to hear what&#39;s he&#39;s saying. If you somehow hear the wretched dialogue he&#39;s reciting, mute the TV. It is better without the sound anyway. Danny Trejo gets shot like 15 times (twice in the HEAD!) and he&#39;s wearing a motorcycle jacket!

Emerging at a crucial period in Japan&#39;s post-war turmoil, he galvanised national pride by defeating bigger, stronger Americans one after another. The naivety of the ordinary masses buying into this manufactured folklore seems twee observed from this distance, but hunger for some kind of hope and national pride in those desperate times is impossible for current generations to imagine.The film does a good job of depicting Rikidozan&#39;s rise to fame, his desire to succeed against discrimination and hierarchical relations, and the flaws in the man&#39;s character that would contribute to his downfall. Kyung-gu Sol in the lead perfectly captures the character. His Japanese is flawless, and he exhibits the hybridity of Rikidozan in his every gesture. Tatsuya Fuji as the oyabun who funds Rikidozan&#39;s path to glory is something we rarely see in films about Japan, a well-rounded, complex yakuza. He sees Riki as a business investment, but also has a surrogate parent-like affection for the man. But he never forgets his role as boss and mentor, and one of the tensions of the story is quite how long this man will go on protecting Riki.Miki Nakatani as put-upon wife Aya is quiet and mysterious. The film becomes more interesting every time she appears, but unfortunately her role is under-written, and the part does now do her acting skills justice.The first 60 minutes expertly chronicle Riki&#39;s rise, the odds he faces, and the significance of all this to post-war Japan. In the last 30 minutes the film sags and a sentimental tone creeps in. This culminates in a last scene that literally looks like it was shot in a giant snow-globe, with toe-curling melodramatic music to match. A tighter edit, and more cinematic approach, could have made this tale truly memorable. However, while the story of Rikidozan grips you, the patchy pacing and average technical skills on display are slightly disappointing.At a time when banal nationalism is rampant in Japan, Rikidozan&#39;s story is a sobering reminder of the complex realities that confound Japanese identity. On a human scale, it is also a competent depiction of how one man&#39;s hubris can lead to a fall.","The life of Korean-born wrestler Rikidôzan, who, after being barred from Japanese wrestling because of his ethnic origins, became a sensation in the United States in the 1950s.The life of Korean-born wrestler Rikidôzan, who, after being barred from Japanese wrestling because of his ethnic origins, became a sensation in the United States in the 1950s.",""

This video production suffers from the impulse of &quot;we paid to have all these cameras and operators on site so we better damn well use them, even if it means ruining the home viewing experience&quot;.Director Nick Morris&#39; shot selection was weak, the frenetic tempo of his camera-to-camera takes overshadows the stage direction. He manages to miss key actor entrances because he has a close-up on another actor. Other times he goes immediately to a close-up for what should be a subtle entrance. This is most obvious with the Phantom&#39;s entrance after Wishing You Were Here Again. Morris commits other unforgivable shot selections like fast cutting close-ups of the destruction of the chandelier rather than giving us the more awe-inspiring audience perspective.And don&#39;t get me started on his coverage of &quot;Masquerade&quot;. One of my favorite scenes on the show is completely ruined by Morris&#39; quick cutting between medium and close-ups of actors, rarely showing us the stage-wide view of the choreography, which is so essential to the power of the scene.The action on Angel of Music is almost impossible to follow, and so on. As I said, abysmal. I&#39;ve seen better directing of local cable channel dramatic productions.This is a stage play that is meant to be seen from farther away than the 6&quot; from the Phantom&#39;s face this director felt we needed. Most certainly someone should have realized that close-ups of actors that included the LED scenic backdrop was just a bad idea. It looks terrible.I&#39;ve seen this show live 3 times but never from the most expensive seats. This video production could have given us the best seats in the house but instead chose to cut quickly between various odd angles that the audience would and should never see.10 stars for the stage production and 3 for the video production.","In 1986, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera arrived on the West End stage at Her Majesty's Theatre. Fast forward 25 years and Phantom has achieved global success, millions of viewers, a film adaptation in 2004 and a musical sequel. Now viewers have the chance to experience this phenomenal show right from their own screens. Filmed at the Royal Albert Hall, this stunning performance brings the show to a bigger stage and celebrates its role as one of the biggest shows in theatre history, with speeches, performances and appearances by the original cast and some of the show's most notable Phantoms, including John Owen-Jones and Colm Wilkinson. Starring Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, Phantom tells the story of a deformed musical genius who lives in the catacombs of the Paris Opera House. Shunned by society, the Phantom seeks revenge in cruel and often violent acts. The Phantom is in love with chorus girl Christine Daaé and has been secretly training her to replace La Carlotta as the opera's reigning diva. However, when Christine is thrust into the spotlight, she is also reunited with childhood friend Raoul. Passion, obsession and chaos ensue as Christine finds herself torn between her love for Raoul and her strange pull towards the mysterious and dangerous Phantom. —LadyN1",""

I then hunted down a copy on VHS and found it in a bargain bin at my local Blockbuster. This film gets better on repeat viewing. As a fan of road movies this film is an unappreciated little gem. Like other lost films of the 80&#39;s, like Miracle Mile, I hope a DVD will be released eventually. Why is it worth checking out? 1. It stars the late, great Chris Penn and 80&#39;s bad boy Adrian Pasdar, of another 80,s cult classic, Near Dark ,fame. 2. The sound track arranged by Sonic Youth, inc. tracks by Timbuk 3 and World Party, like any good road movie ,is excellent, e.g. Wild At Heart and Easy Rider. 3.What makes this different, unlike most road movies, is that it shows the America not of wonderful scenery and natural beauty but of ecological and economic decline during the era of Reagonomics. 4. The cinema-photography is extremely powerful, showing us a normally unseen side of the American landscape. 5.With its unsympathetic characters, on the road, looking for redemption in one form or another,the film is a nod to Easy Rider. But this being the 80&#39;s they travel by stealing cars or trucks, pass through ecological disaster areas and the goal of their quest is a beach babe in a surfing magazine. The possible reason for the film&#39;s disappearance? 1.Lori Singer. Lori Singer. Lori Singer.Oh ,dear remember her? a flaky character played by Miss Kooky 1988. 2. The wolf.This story thread just does not make any sense at all. All cult films must have some moments of imperfection. But for it&#39;s bravery in going against the grain in the era of Rambo it deserves some recognition.","Two men from Pennsylvania give up hope in their small run down coal mining town, and head off in search of the beaches of California.

I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially for those familiar with Morris&#39;s warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.The runner&#39;s commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having worked as a runner myself, it&#39;s often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking industry), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend &quot;Franz Kafka&#39;s It&#39;s A Wonderful Life&quot;, by Peter Capaldi.","Adapted from a monologue in his ""Blue Jam"" radio series, Chris Morris' first short film is a haunting black comedy about a man who no longer uses his name because he's decided he's ceased to deserve one, and a dog called Rothko who says he is the man's lawyer.

They start off with untraditional methods to get him to confess. This is the start of this British crime thriller, which follows in the great tradition of this kind from the isles. The start is bleak, but takes on a strong turn, which grabs your interest intensively.A strong cast, with Paul Bettany and Stephen Graham leading on, with great Brian Cox as the father, and Mark Strong as a colleague, and Ben Crompton as the pedophile. Strong performances all over, also from the kids. Bettany is great when he gets this haunted look.The film is suspenseful and atmospheric, though filmed in bleach colors, making in just the more real looking.

In some ways, it&#39;s a bad film--with poor writing and terribly shallow characters. I am not going to gloss over these problems--and they are serious. However, at the same time, the film appears to be amazingly good looking and professional--an odd combination, I know. To me, it has all the look of a fan production--a movie made for sci-fi fans and not intended for general release. And, if this was the case, you cannot really compare the film to a traditional movie. But, apparently it is being released on DVD and Amazon, for instance, is planning on releasing selling it in September.So while I like some of the fan films, it&#39;s because I don&#39;t mind when the film has some rough edges--I expect them. And many of the best Star Trek and Star Wars fan films are very rough but also very enjoyable. As I watched &quot;Starship: Rising&quot;, it appeared to be a fan film and thought the editor had sent me a fan film. A fan film, by the way, isn&#39;t intended for the average schnook out there--just the ultra-devoted sci- fi folks who might pick up a copy at a convention or pass it among themselves. &quot;Starship: Rising&quot;, however, must be held to a higher standard if it&#39;s being released to the general public. Neil Johnson wrote and directed the film and despite its many problems, it&#39;s also kind of amazing. Well, The CGI, while not up to the quality of a big-budget Hollywood film is surprisingly good and at times sure comes close to what you&#39;d see in a big-budget theatrical release. I remember years ago when &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was the first TV show that exclusively used CGI for its outer space scenes and they were cool but rough (though the excellent writing more than made up for these shortcomings). However, &quot;Starship: Rising&quot; has graphics that are light- years ahead of those--and I was blown away that a relatively inexpensive film could look this good. And, it&#39;s not all looks--the soundtrack is very nice as well. It doesn&#39;t sound cheap at all and works well, though I&#39;ll admit that it is, occasionally repetitive. Together, they make a film that has a very professional look. As for the story about a dystopian galactic world where an insane leader is bent on destroying Terra (Earth), it has its moments and the various planetscapes look good. So, you have a film that is awfully rough and yet awfully good. I don&#39;t recommend it for the casual viewer but for hardcore lovers of sci-fi or folks who like fan pictures and have modest expectations, it&#39;s well worth your time. The casual viewer, on the other hand, will no doubt have serious problems with the writing and acting--they just didn&#39;t seem polished or ready for a full-length film. A nice try...and perhaps with experience Johnson will be able to pull it all together.By the way, if you want to see a micro-budgeted sci-fi film that manages to have the great look you expect from a sci-fi outer space film AND great writing and characters, try to find a copy of &quot;Hunter Prey&quot;. It is exceptional and packs a lot into a tiny budget...and you&#39;d never notice the small budget when you see it on the screen.","Starship One... the most powerful prototype warship in the Federation, capable of destroying entire worlds. Two empires at war: the corrupt Federation, and the oppressive Terra Nostra. Entire planets are being wiped out. When the order is given to destroy the Earth, Federation Flight Lieutenant John Worthy kills his superior officer and mutineers Starship One. Demanding that both sides make peace, he becomes the target of both sides of the war. Worthy is pursued across the galaxy by General Gustav, an infamous military commander who brings the entire Federation fleet down upon Worthy and his Starship. After a number of intense battles, and suffering heavy vessel damage, Worthy aligns himself with an underground rebellion. He is entrusted with vessel upgrades and a robot army he needs to bring down both sides of the war.

This is the first review. It&#39;s a fascinating movie.
A story of a man looking for a wish. You get no more plot discussion from me!The script was much better than I expected for a low budget movie. It&#39;s clever. It doesn&#39;t follow normal movie cliches. Just when you think you have a grasp of where it&#39;s heading, it turns.
What makes it interesting is that these turns are logical based on the framework of the plot. They all fit together and create a world where the multiple valid conclusions are possible.
Many of the actors are stiff, but Roger Conners and John Maslowski played their roles exceptionally. I assumed Conners would &quot;go over the top&quot; with his character but he played it with the perfect creepy finesse.
Except for the action scenes, which were awful, and the special effects which were worse, the film was shot beautifully.
I watch lots of movies. Usually at least one per day. Many of them low budget like this one. Most are lame and weak. I was shocked that this unknown movie with unknown actors could create such a wonderfully bizzare story. With an actual compelling theme too!
Thank You!!No. I do not know anyone involved in anyway with this movie!","In a perfect, violent-free world, a young vagabond must decide between human decency or self-interest when it comes to the matter of assassinating three people and gifting their corpses to a powerful figure full of impossible wishes.In a perfect, violent-free world, a young vagabond must decide between human decency or self-interest when it comes to the matter of assassinating three people and gifting their corpses to a powerful figure full of impossible wishes.",""

The earliest shows The First Presidency (Joseph F. Smith, Anton H. Lund, & John Henry Smith) during the time of the General Conference of the church in April, 1910. Much of the remainder of the film was taken at the time of the General Conference of April, 1916. However, some footage up through the 1920's is also included.

Originally shot at 16 frames per second, the scenes were converted to 24 fps for sound projection by printing every other frame twice.

T. Max Graham who plays the irascible Jake has one gruesome but hilarious scene towards the climatic end.

They are both hilarious and poignant in this Carrie Fisher story about a show business daughter coming through the process of working out emotional trauma and baggage in relation to her mother, upbringing and subsequent addiction problems.  Also especially good is Gene Hackman in a small supporting role and a cameo by Rob Reiner. Streep and MacLaine carry this film with their talents and are very entertaining as they confront each other and themselves about personal flaws and foibles.  What makes this work so well is the smart and oblique humor that is employed to address the internal pain of the main character. I also liked the little jabs at the movie industry itself as well as its nonchalant way of revealing some of it&#39;s visual tricks too.    
One particular touching and bittersweet scene is between Hackman (as movie director) as he comforts Streep (an actress he&#39;s working with) with a sort of lighthearted understanding and encouragement to overcome her drug addiction as he builds her up with appreciation of her talent.Considering the obvious autobiographical nature of this story for Fisher, it would appear to be sort of a catharsis for her. She does a good job in bringing painful personal issues to light with humor through her writing. Personal pain and demons often seem to be the source of great art and entertainment as well as amusement for many artists and through their art, for the rest of us as well. This is a case in point and definitely worth the time.","Substance-addicted Hollywood actress Suzanne Vale is on the skids.

Riis who emigrated to the United States and became famous for his photo documentarism about the poverty of New York in the early twentieth century. This subject is excellent; for Americans and Danes alike this is an interesting and relevant chapter in our shared history, and one that at least Danes are commonly unaware of.However, the manner in which the story is told here leaves me cold. A subject which would certainly have made a good documentary, and quite possibly a good feature film, is turned into something which is both and neither. Swedish actor Peter Stormare narrates as Riis from a manuscript which is probably inspired by Riis&#39; book &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, interrupted only by a few paragraphs narrated by Anna Christine Löf as Riis&#39; lost love Elisabeth. Stormare speaks with a touch of a Scandinavian accent blended into an American accent so thick it seems affected. Most of all, though, it is the monotony and melancholy of his reading and the frequent sentimentality of the text that are annoyances. This is accompanied by an imagery consisting of Riis&#39; black-and-white photographs, black-and-white reconstructions of situations from Riis&#39; experiences in New York, and some colour footage of present-day poverty in America. Trying to link the poverty of a century ago with the poverty of today is a good idea, but the attempt is much too unsubstantiated, and there is really very little of visual interest other than Riis&#39; own photographs which are seen only briefly. Some hand-written lines of Riis&#39; writings are used as graphical elements, but there are no actual historical sources referenced in the film. While this may be natural in a dramatic work it leaves me as a viewer strangely uninterested and not much more knowledgeable about Jacob A. Riis and his work.","Drama-documentary which tells the story of Jacob A.

Director Eddie Romero patently believes that use of dialogue adds little to a movie&#39;s sense of purpose and as with a great deal of his work, this effort is composed essentially of long scenes of various combinations of men shooting at each other, but with such as the wooden Derek and the rather untalented Bronwyn Fitzsimons as leading players, it is perhaps an advantage to let the guns do the talking.","The biggest war picture ever filmed in the Philippines: a savage, raw, action-packed spectacle of men and women in war, filmed with a cast and cost never attempted before in a film for world release.The biggest war picture ever filmed in the Philippines: a savage, raw, action-packed spectacle of men and women in war, filmed with a cast and cost never attempted before in a film for world release.",""

Riveting in its content, rich in its emotion, and outstanding in its technique, this film flirts with greatness. Indeed, the moving narration provided by both Elizabeth Taylor and Orson Welles is among the most impassioned, most heartfelt, in cinematic history.Alas, despite its overall excellence, the film must be &quot;marked down&quot; because of its apparent disregard for internal consistency. Don&#39;t get me wrong - everything (and more) of what it recounts is factually true. And all of the documentary evidence it presents is as real as the screen you&#39;re looking at. No, what bothered me was the tendency over and over again for the filmmaker to use photographic material inaccurately. So, for example, to help paint the picture of the Holocaust on the Eastern Front, we are presented with multiple black and white photographs of hangings. The trouble is that many of the photos were neither of Jews nor of the Holocaust. They were of partisans and commissars (also hunted and slaughtered by the Nazis). Likewise, while the narration describes an &#39;aktion&#39; in Lithuania, the photos we see are from assaults on Jewish women in Lvov. I could go on, but think you get the idea.Again, please don&#39;t misinterpret me. I am not at all challenging the general veracity of the film nor the importance of its message. My quarrel is, simply, that too many of the illustrations used to complement the narrative are out of place and inaccurate. By and large, this probably makes little difference to things overall (whether someone was murdered in 1943 or 1944, and whether by hanging or by a bullet to the back of the neck, is irrelevant in the total enormity of the Holocaust). However, given the reality of revisionists and deniers, the last thing one would want to do, especially when making a film that in some sense &quot;proves&quot; the Holocaust, is to give the disbelievers any ammunition for their perverted cause. Frankly, I&#39;m distressed by such careless selection and use of photos. I fear that this could cost the film credibility - credibility in the eyes of those who most need to have them opened.","A chilling, heartbreaking testament to the strength and suffering of the Jewish people and the courage and heroism of those who came to their aid. With beautiful narration by Orson Welles and Elizabeth Taylor the film begins by providing a look at the flourishing Jewish community in pre-war Europe and then traces their grim trajectory through the ghettos, camps, and prisons of the Nazi regime, introducing the lost victims and brave heroes along the way. —AnonymousA chilling, heartbreaking testament to the strength and suffering of the Jewish people and the courage and heroism of those who came to their aid.

There have been several movies on this subject but Rooks takes a different turn. I liked her direction and she really put effort into presenting the time and the horror of the war without flooding the film with graphic images and sounding preachy. Even if there are few such scenes they are used minimally. In one very effective scene we see corpses float on a river as the villagers silently stare. None of the bodies are shown from close range and yet the scene is so impactive. Some viewers have disapproved the use of foul language. However, I think it adds to the rawness of the hot-headed villagers. I haven&#39;t read the original novel (I didn&#39;t know it was an adaptation until afterwards) but many are disappointed mainly due of the lack of development). At some point, the film seemed to move at a sluggish pace until it swiftly picks up in the last half hour. Some characters did require development, especially Iqbal. Mohan Agase as the ignorant head of the village conveys the complexity of his character with complete ease especially in the scenes where he reflects himself as the man he he has become compared to who he used to be. Nirmal Pandey provides some comic relief. He&#39;s a little loud with dramatics but overall it&#39;s a good effort. Sadly, Rajit Kapoor&#39;s Iqbal suffers even though the actor makes the best of what he has. He seems to have taken his pants off for no significant reason as his character isn&#39;t given much scope. Divya Dutta does alright but the dubbing (clearly someone else&#39;s voice) does hinder the acting (as the voice sounds too childlike for a professional prostitute). Smriti Mishra is adequate. Much of the supporting cast were a little too dramatic. Comparisons have often been made between books and movies and usually books win. But, having not read the book (which I intend to) I was generally pleased by &#39;Train to Pakistan&#39;. It could have been better but it&#39;s not bad. I liked the powerful ending as, without derailing from the main story, it avoided the &#39;cliched art-film&#39; ending (I thought it would end with graphic images of the bloodbath).","Seen from the eyes of Hukum Chand the District Magistrate it is an account of the turmoil faced by the inhabitants of village Mano Majra in Punjab on the Indo- Pak border during the period of partition after India attained independence.

At first its subjects seem simple, but like many people do, these characters are merely shielding themselves, hesitant to reveal much of their real natures except as as rare gifts in intimate moments. It must have been tremendously challenging to create and portray natural introverts like these characters, but as an introvert myself (I assert that characteristic without any touch of self-disparagement), I found this story rewardingly resonant of my own experience, especially of childhood memories, although indeed my outward circumstances had little in common with this story.Almost never has any film conveyed a sense and feeling of a few small places so clearly and so effortlessly. We cherished the village in &quot;Local Hero&quot;, but Fingerbone is an incomparably more realistic and deftly drawn place (despite occasional overreaching, e.g., the town&#39;s name, and a train accident that stretches credulity in more than one way).For anyone willing to watch, dusk and the blue pre-dawn illuminate and suffuse these characters&#39; lives. Sylvie sits by herself in the &quot;dark&quot;, but there are wonderful secrets to discover in places that seem a void to others. Even well-meaning intrusions, like interruptions to meditation, can seem tragic.Even more distinctly than Forsyth&#39;s other work, this film certainly wouldn&#39;t appeal to everyone, but it is a beautiful and evocative character study that has the courage to deal with personalities, events and emotions too obscure or inaccessible for most mainstream filmmakers.  Forsyth deserves credit for having gotten this made in the first place, as well as for the eclectic perception that gave the film its many unique and worthwhile qualities.","In the Pacific Northwest in 1955, two young sisters, abandoned by their mother, wind up living with their Aunt Sylvie, whose views of the world and its conventions don't quite live up to most people's expectations. —Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>; edited by Peter VictorIn the Pacific Northwest in 1955, two young sisters, abandoned by their mother, wind up living with their Aunt Sylvie, whose views of the world and its conventions don't quite live up to most people's expectations. —Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>; edited by Peter Victor",""

Many of these religious themed movies fall in a trap of becoming too cheesy and too in your face for a main stream audience. This one is an exception. As expected there are some very religious aspects to this, but its never in your face or distracting enough to make you feel like you are being preached to. In fact even though everyone knows the story of this movie they never use the name Jesus. The movie is movie of a detective/missing body movie that a religious epic. For that reason the movie is main stream, watchable and something I did like a lot more than I expected to.

Veteran comedian Mehmood&#39;s nephew Binju Ali was cast opposite Juhi while Gaurav formed her secret admirer to complete the love triangle.Two top class directors - Tinnu Anand and Ashutosh Gowariker- were cast as actors and I quite liked Gowariker here as the Konkani speaking goon. Goonj is probably the only Hindi film where the actors speak fluent Konkani unlike the recent Dum Maro Dum Maaro Dum (2011) where the Konkani pronounciation left a lot to be desired.The songs attributable to Biddu were simply superb. &quot;Sama yeh suhaana&quot;, &quot;Jawaani ke din hai&quot; and the rap number &quot;Love Technology&quot; are still memorable. However, my personal favourite is the &quot;Soota&quot; song which had become an anthem of sorts amongst the young smokers of that time. If the song had come today, it would&#39;ve been instantly banned. Haha!!Unfortunately, Goonj wasn&#39;t publicised that well and its offbeat theme didnt find takers at the time of its theatrical release. The film continues to remain in oblivion even though its contemporary theme and treatment still makes it a good watch. Do give it a try!!Regards,

While conducting field work in the desert, scientist John Agar encounters a huge floating brain which turns out to be a sadistic, power-hungry alien name Gor, a fugitive from it&#39;s home planet. The alien can become translucent and fade into Agar&#39;s body, controlling him while it uses its telekinetic powers and delights in the pleasures of human flesh.  But it has to come out every twenty hours to `re-oxygenate&#39; (?). Admittedly the alien is not badly designed (the brain has strange glowing eyes with no pupils). Whenever Gor/Agar is using his telekinetic powers, Agar&#39;s eyes become shiny black orbs (an nice bit of makeup).  Gor/Agar demonstrates his mental powers of  destruction for a group of generals and diplomats by `willing&#39; an atomic explosion to occur in the nearby desert (great stock footage of buildings being destroyed  by shock waves and heat flashes).  Then Gor/Agar orders them to put Earth&#39;s population to work creating a space fleet so he can return to his own planet and conquer it.Meanwhile, a second alien name Vol comes to Earth to save it from Gor.  To spy on Gor, Vol takes control of Agar&#39;s dog.  Vol/dog elicits the aid of Agar&#39;s fiancé (lovely Joyce Meadows).  She&#39;s glad to help, because she already knew SOMETHING was wrong with Agar after he turned kinky and tried to rape her on a lawn chair.Beware: the finale is a short and unexciting struggle between Agar (armed with an ax) and the floating Gor brain.  And Agar&#39;s closing line to his fiancé&#39; is painfully stupid.  When she tries to tell him that a good-guy alien has been in control of the dog, John doesn&#39;t believe her. He just laughs and says,  `Oh, honey -- that imagination of yours!&#39;If you&#39;re absolutely desperate for a 1950s sci-fi flick you haven&#39;t already watched to death, this one might be worth watching -- but only to laugh at.","Gor, a powerful criminal brain from the planet Arous, assumes the body of scientist Steve March. Through March, he begins to control the world by threatening destruction to any country challenging his domination. Another brain, Val, works with March's future wife Sally to defeat Gor. Val explains that Gor will be vulnerable when he is forced to leave March at intervals to re-energize. Gor's vulnerable spot, the Fissure of Orlando, is described in a note left by Sally in Steve's lab. —ApostrophesGor, a powerful criminal brain from the planet Arous, assumes the body of scientist Steve March.

For much of the film the director and his crew create very off center images, for example Stan&#39;s shrink sits in front of a wall of light boxes on which we see brain scans and x-rays and the film uses the images created by shooting through a fish tank to good effect. The film also resorts to an odd short hand by echoing other (better) serial killer films by having Stan living in a place that is similar to Kevin Spacey&#39;s home in Se7en, be interested in photography like the killer in Manhunter not to mention other riffs and rip offs. This isn&#39;t as bad as some have made it out to be since the film often uses them to disorienting effect since its clear thats we are no where near Kansas. Frankly having made it to the end I&#39;m not sure what I just saw.For the most part the film works, unfortunately it has one serious flaw and that is its pacing is way too lack. The film wastes much of its tension and disorientation simply because it doesn&#39;t know when to move on to the next thing. I think one&#39;s like or dislike of this film will be tied to one&#39;s ability to deal with the slow pace. I like the film and can recommend it with the warning that it is a slow movie.7 out of 10 (its probably really a 6 but there are some images and bits that I really like).","A mentally unstable man who doesn't have a firm grip on reality must investigate whether or not he's a serial killer.A mentally unstable man who doesn't have a firm grip on reality must investigate whether or not he's a serial killer.","FRF 4,000,000.00"

""In the Fray"" is the second of two pieces made in collaboration with the Saskatoon Jazz Orchestra (SJO) for a project called Dimensions in Sound, simulating the phenomenon of sound synesthesia. This project builds on a previous collaboration with the orchestra in 2018, when Glenn created and projected a 3D animation including shapes represented categories of instruments - percussion, brass, and wind - to simulate the movements that she ""saw"" in her mind's eye (i.e., timbre shape chromesthesia). Allyson received the music and began the animations by selecting open-source video footage of damaged vintage film that could capture the scratchy, painterly, and fluid shapes of the music in her mind's eye. With assistants Shelby Lund (Master of Fine Arts (MFA) student University of Saskatchewan), Lucy Zhou (BSc), and Nicole Leroy (MFA), she created drawings using the rotoscope method to transcribe the collaged footage. While this piece focuses on the illusion of film, it also investigates our relationship to technology. Beginning with a descent into a hole in the ground, the animation lures the viewer to experience series of analogue and digital abstractions. Like the phrase 'internet rabbit hole' where infinite search engine paths lead to disorientation, the title phrase ""In the fray"" can also suggest a struggle, a deconstruction and re-arrangement of form. This idea is captured by transitions between scenes where geometrical shapes morph and change. Like the title and themes in Carroll's iconic story Alice in Wonderland, what and who emerges from the hole is inevitably different and forever changed. —Allyson Glenn","CA$9,200.00"

On full-moon nights a blue light emanates from this secret grotto, luring young men from the valley to seek out the force of the radiant beam. Their quest invariably end in death and causes the towns-people to vilify junta. A painter from Vienna, Vigo, befriends the outcast woman. He becomes her protector and falls in love with her. Following her one blue-lit night, he discovers the way to the cave. He draws a map, thinking that the safe passage to the grotto will serve the best interest of both Junta and the villagers. The towns-people arm themselves with tools and climb to the cave, plundering the valuable crystals and celebrating their new found fortune.Riefenstahl&#39;s film -(fantasy) sanctifies nature and reflects a fascination with beauty and harmony. The photography of this picture is visually stunning, and Riefenstahl&#39;s masculine beauty and physical abilities make her the perfect choice for the role of Junta. `Das blaue Licht&#39; is one of the last great Weimar films and  a must  see&#39; not only for movie buffs.","Junta is hated by the people in the village where she lives, especially by the women, who suspect her of being a witch. Only she can climb the nearby mountains to a cave high up, whence a mysterious blue light glows when the moon is full. Many young men of the village have died trying to follow her.

I would like to clarify the record on Elena&#39;s and my participation in this documentary. Elena and I did not meet through a marriage agency. I have a collection of Russian Icons and was in Moscow to see the city and the museums. I was also open to meeting a younger woman with more traditional values who would be interested in and capable of having a large family. In Los Angeles, California I couldn&#39;t even get arrested trying to find this combination and had given up. I happened by pure chance to walk into a shop that Elena was managing, a costume shop that was located in the foyer of an opera house in Moscow. As a former professional musician I was intrigued that a commercial shop would be located in such an unlikely location. When I saw Elena I commented to my guide that if I were to meet a woman, that would be the type (at least as far as looks) that I would be interested in. My guide took the initiative and arranged a meeting between us. That was in September of 1996. Now, in 2006, we are still happy as clams, have five children and are planning one more. We were introduced to Shannon, the documentary director, as a &quot;Russian-American&quot; marriage success by a former tenant of ours who was a producer on &quot;Survivor&quot;. We have had numerous people who have seen the documentary contact us through the phone book or at Elena&#39;s website for her art (Google &quot;Elena Roche&quot;). They have uniformly commented that they were inspired and heartened by our success.","Several young ""Russian mail order brides"" are followed over a three year period as they meet, date, and, in some cases, marry the American men who found them through some of the 80 to 100 ""Russian Mail Order Bride"" agencies now available in the US and the former Soviet Union. —AnonymousSeveral young ""Russian mail order brides"" are followed over a three year period as they meet, date, and, in some cases, marry the American men who found them through some of the 80 to 100 ""Russian Mail Order Bride"" agencies now available in the US and the former Soviet Union. —Anonymous","$300,000.00"

A friend who attended the special preview at Shaw Lido IMAX had mentioned that Hubble 3D was one of the trailers shown as an up and coming feature, but I remain a skeptic because I can&#39;t imagine a commercial cinema operator wanting to showcase a 40 minute documentary, when it probably can make a lot more showing the latest blockbusters in the format. I will be glad to stand corrected, but it remains to be seen.The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit some 21 years ago to much fanfare, and even more fuss made over it when it was discovered it had myopia (OK, in case you really think I meant that, it had faulty mirrors). So more space programmes were launched to have its telescopic sight fixed through the application of contact lens equivalents, and since then we&#39;ve been treated to some of the most astounding pictures captured of our galaxy and beyond. This film chronicles the final servicing mission undertaken by the crew of Space Shuttle Atlantis in May 2009, and in fact is quite lightweight in treatment and narrative.There isn&#39;t much of a background on what and how Hubble was designed and conceived - you&#39;re left to your own devices to get chummy with the telescope. The bulk of the documentary focuses on the crew of the Atlantis and their mission at hand, from ground training at NASA, to the blast off from the launchpad, with quick glimpses of their life aboard the shuttle, before a rather detailed look at their space walk and repair at hand, with the narration, by Leonardo DiCaprio, focused on the danger of having their suits ripped by sharp, pointy objects as part of their work.The other focus of Hubble the film is on the images captured by it, which gives space and astronomy idiots like myself a quick and slight introduction to stars, systems, nebulas and the peek inside those astonishing vastness of space invisible to the naked eye. With infra-red lenses too we get to see past space clouds that mask hidden gems beneath, and truly that&#39;s something that made this documentary stand out a little.Still, I would have preferred if it had a more holistic approach to Hubble, but for what it is, presented on an IMAX format, it&#39;s still quite something to behold.

The humor was clever, especially the verbal stuff between T.C. and...who ever he was tricking at the moment, the gang of cats was fun (my favorite was Cho- cho) and I love the mood it had. It&#39;s one of those kids show I actually found myself to appreciate more as adult just for how smart it was.While the first few five-ten minutes made ma go &quot;Meh&quot; , as soon the gang was reintroduce the movie actually become quite good. It&#39;s a very basic story but it those an excellent job of recapturing the spirit and the humor of the original show. All characters where well, in character, and some of the English voice actors where dead-on perfect (especially T.C., Dibble and Benny) There where some great absurd jokes, some good Simpson-style gags that take you off gourd and play with a viewer expectation, as well some small twists and in-jokes for the fans of the original TV show (I especially love the part In the middle where Cho-cho become new leader of the gang and they spoof the opening credits with the gang recapturing all of the Top Cats tricks and felling miserably) Yhe, the animation in this movie is far from cinematic standards but it was it&#39;s still enjoyable to watch (to be honest I was having flash-backs from computer game &quot;UFO&#39;S&quot; which had identical bland of 3D and flash animation) What surprise me is the fact I actually liked the villain. When I saw this guy in the trailer for the first time I was sure I will hate this character. He was just so generic But no! Most the jokes about how vain and angry he was actually worked an I liked how over the top he got with his plot. I only have few nitpicks with the movie :– I wish there where more Top-Cat/Dibble interaction. For me the hate/love relationship between the two was the heath of the show and while here their both 100% in character there&#39;s not that much dialog between the two. I wish they would had a longer scene where T.C. somehow tricks or scams Dibble. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter if your fan of the show since your already know their history together but if your new to these characters you will won&#39;t fell any friendship or relation between this two. – The show had a wonderful New York atmosphere (mainly thanks to the jazzy sound track and great backgrounds) Here It could take place in any other city. I just wish they would kept the background closer to resembling those on the show. – Cho-Cho&#39;s voice didn&#39;t sound like the original character I wouldn&#39;t even bother to bring this up if not for the fact that they did such a great job of recapturing all other characters voices so well. – Trixie was a very generic/cliché sympathetic girl and a love interest for Top-Cat which makes here very bland comparing to the rest of the cast. This is more of personal pet pea. I just hate when they introduce a main female character and have no idea for her personality other then the fact she&#39;s a female, especially since all the feline fame fatal&#39;s from the show usually hat a lot of character. Heck! Fancy&#39;s girlfriend who appears in two short scenes appear to be way more funny and interesting – There was one or two grow-out jokes that didn&#39;t felt in the spirit of the cartoon;But those are just nitpicks. Over all – if you a Top Cat fan and you would love see those characters again in action then this movie should be good nostalgia trip for you, and to be honest this movie was made ONLY for Top Cat fans and you can sense the passion script writers had for the original show. Heck! I found it better then &quot;Top Cat and Beverly Hills Cats&quot; which felt like 20 minute of plot stretch to hour and a half. Here ad lead they had ideas and jokes to feel this time. However if your not a Top Cat fan It&#39;s just a OK cartoon but It will entertain you . Watching this I actually wish the same guys would do another Top-Cat remake show, as the movie did manage to add some fresh light without making it too modern. 8/10 should be a fair score","Top Cat and the gang face a new police chief, who is not at all happy with Officer Dibble's performance in trying to prevent Top Cat's scams.

Doris Day and Gordon MacRae are clearly too old for the roles they play but here it doesn&#39;t seem to matter--their courtship scenes are charming and both display their unique vocal abilities in a number of songs. Especially good is Jack C. Smith as Hubert, Doris&#39; persistent suitor who won&#39;t take no for an answer. And Ellen Corby is a delight as a schoolteacher intent on straightening out the misbehaving Billy Gray, who all but walks off with the film as the kid brother from hell.Very pleasant family film, very much in the tradition of others like MARGIE, LIFE WITH FATHER and MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, with its own brand of charm. Good light entertainment, the kind of musical not made these days, unpretentious and sometimes wickedly funny.

Still get much enjoyment out of them now as a young adult, even if there are more interesting in personality cartoon characters and better overall cartoons.That is in no way knocking Woody, because many of his cartoons are a lot of fun to watch and more and also still like him a lot as a character. While it is perhaps one of the better 1963 Sid Marcus-directed Woody Woodpecker cartoons, &#39;Science Friction&#39; is a long way from being a classic (it&#39;s not even good), and if it is somewhat of a reiteration of previous reviews for Marcus-directed Woody cartoons it&#39;s simply because of it having the same strengths and faults. It does prove to me that Woody at this point was well past his glory days and that Walter Lantz Studios had run out of ideas long before, evidenced in tired and repetitive situations, toning Woody&#39;s personality down, animation limitations, very variable opponents and even more hit and miss humour. The music and voice work were pretty much the only things that were near-consistently good.Starting with the good things, the music is bouncy, energetic and very lushly orchestrated, not only synchronising and fitting with the action very well but enhancing it. There is the occasional bout of energy, and there is one surprise which is the ending, which could easily have been a formula ending but wasn&#39;t.Voice acting is solid. Grace Stafford in particular continues to prove why she was the best voice actor for the character and the one that understood him the most. Of the characters, the best character is the ape, a large part of why the ending works and is the highlight of the cartoon.On the other hand, the mad scientist is the sort of character we&#39;ve seen in animation many times before and since and there is nothing to them that makes him stand out, very instantly forgettable and more bumbling than mad. Woody&#39;s personality once again is dulled down and nothing like when he was in his prime in the 40s all the way through to the mid-50s, his material isn&#39;t fun enough being too derivative and he doesn&#39;t even have enough to him to be a pest let alone manic.Generally there is a lack of energy once again, this is fairly routine as far as Woody Woodpecker cartoons go rather than the original manic energy and it all feels very safe when early and prime Woody Woodpecker took risks.Chemistry in &#39;Science Friction&#39; is bland, thanks to the under-characterising of the characters (apart from the ape), and not much is particularly funny, with lacklustre timing, not enough laughs and less than witty gags. Very little is done to give freshness to a very formulaic story heavy in repetition and it&#39;s all derivative of better stuff.Just as problematic is the animation quality. Time and budget constraints shows in a lot of the animation, which is very rushed looking in the drawing and detail wise it&#39;s on the simplistic and careless side like many of Woody&#39;s cartoons from this period continuing through to the 60s.In conclusion, very lacklustre. 4/10 Bethany Cox","A mad scientist introduces himself to us (""Come!

While fleeing a petty crime, young Jerry Florea is shot and wounded by Edward Gallagher, a Boston policeman. Florea&#39;s injury prevents him from ever having children, and, feeling remorse, Gallagher visits the kid in the hospital, where their bonding begins. However, despite Gallagher&#39;s encouragement to reform, Florea continues to mastermind and carry out various crimes, which include one major heist that nets $2.5 million.The excellent cast features Sal Mineo as the tough young Florea, a smart kid and natural leader of his gang of delinquents. Mineo matures into Tony Curtis as the adult delinquent, who invests in a chain of service stations, while he perseveres in crime despite a string of arrests and incarcerations. Intentionally naive to Florea&#39;s false promises and duplicitous nature, George Nader as Gallagher is sturdy as the overly patient, overly loyal cop; having made a moral bargain with himself, Gallagher is willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for Florea&#39;s inside information on other criminals. As Gallagher&#39;s wife, Julie Adams is equally blind to Florea&#39;s true nature and assumes that &quot;settling down&quot; will solve everything, a quaint 1950&#39;s concept. However, a tough J.C. Flippen as Concannon, Gallagher&#39;s superior, appears more objective. Unfortunately, Curtis maintains a smirk throughout that undercuts any credibility in his character&#39;s words and any believability that Gallagher could trust him.After a needless and insipid Henry Mancini title song mercifully concludes, the fine black-and-white wide-screen cinematography by William H. Daniels opens on the film&#39;s Boston street locations, which include the six bridges of the title. Directed by Joseph Pevney, a contract director at Universal Studios, from a screenplay by Sydney Boehm, &quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot; is an engrossing well-acted crime drama that features a capable cast. The film&#39;s flaws slip by, Curtis&#39;s charms are apparent, and two hours pleasantly pass.","Youth gang leader Jerry Florea is shot fleeing from a crime scene by rookie cop Ed Gallagher.

However, within that category, &quot;big&quot; PPs based on big crimes are not that common. In fact, you would have to go back to the early 70s when a number of &quot;big PPs&quot; like Day of the Jackal 1973 were all the rage.So, a film like this done properly (and, trust me, this one is done perfectly) would be a treat all by itself. However, what makes this film extra-special is the extensive use of video footage.Now, to be clear, video footage as a plot device is not new by itself. It is now, and has been used extensively in British film and TV because, as we all know, London is the most &quot;surveyed&quot; city on the planet.But -- the point -- nothing the Brits have ever done with the forensic use of video comes even close to what Berg brings us in this excellent film. Much the same way that the original creators of CSI-Vegas introduced an entirely new sort of sub-genre, it can be argued that Patriots Day similarly has taken the police procedural to an entirely new level.The film itself? Brilliant! Berg has taken a stellar group of A-listers and make them work as a team, mirroring on the subliminal level the theme of the movie, which is both positive, and hopeful, and suggests that if we all work together, we can accomplish pretty much anything.","On April 15, 2013 Boston, Massachusetts, Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders is pulling security duty on the annual Boston Marathon when the Tsarnaev brothers strike with their homemade bombs in an act of terrorism.

Karmakate is the last survivor of his tribe, living in the heart of the Colombian Amazon. At two separate points in time, he is asked by foreign scientists&#39; Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evan Schultes -- both with different purposes -- on how to find a scared healing plant. The film borrows a lot of its content from their diaries from when they had commissioned Karmakate to help them in 1909 and 1940, respectively. He is conflicted as he has no ambition to help &quot;the White man&quot; because his tribe was wiped from the Earth by them, and he lives his days by himself.The film doesn&#39;t beat around the bush. As it progresses, it becomes evident that the story is about the devastation of colonialism and what it had done to the land &amp; its people. Everything from spreading Catholicism to Rubber Farming, more and more they see the land changing for the worse. It was impressive to not only hear these actors speaking Spanish, but also being able to converse in the native tongue of the locals, including the several other languages that were used through out the film. Couple that with the beautiful cinematography, and you have yourself quite the masterpiece.Fans of Miguel Gomes&#39; &#39;Tabu&#39; would likely enjoy this. Shot in black and white. Beautiful transitions and landscape shots. Winner of the Art Cinema Award at Cannes. Expect this film to go for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars.","The story of the relationship between Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people, and two scientists who work together over the course of forty years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing plant.The story of the relationship between Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people, and two scientists who work together over the course of forty years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing plant.","$1,400,000.00"

Doctor Stackhouse's task is complicated by the patients' shared delusion that they have been chosen to protect the sovereign shores of the United States from drug smugglers.

As it&#39;s said in the film, probably 80% of all silent films are now lost forever and there&#39;s a real danger that many surviving films might not remain that way because they&#39;re sitting in vault getting worse and worse with each passing day. This 30-minute documentary takes a look at the various issues with nitrate and even shows us some old footage of fires caused by the explosive material. We see how studios treated their films in the early days and we hear rather depressing stories about how many studios simply threw their film prints away or dumped them in the ocean. There&#39;s a rather amazing story of MGM wanting to get rid of all their nitrate prints and thankfully George Eastman House took them in or perhaps GONE WITH THE WIND, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and THE WIZARD OF OZ might not be around today in the condition that they&#39;re in. Fans of cinema really need to take a look at this and see that there&#39;s plenty of work that needs to be done in order to save countless films.","Lost Forever examines our rich and diverse American film heritage.

Notorious for being banned due to its explicit nudity and sexual content, this film will strike viewers either as pretentious nonsense or as an unforgettable depiction of neurosis.Graciela Borges and Arturo Puig star as a couple who run a kindergarten in the Argentinean countryside. The characters have the same names as the actors. Graciela is troubled, to say the least. She keeps the mummified remains of her father, talks to the corpse, and takes it for a walk. At times she tries too hard to connect with her stepson Leonardo; other times she rejects him violently. Arturo is only slightly more normal. His attempts to calm Graciela down often lead to aggression.The film jumps from the &quot;real&quot; to the symbolic constantly and without warning. Sudden scenes that appear to have no relation to what was going on before actually depict psychological states. The entire film may be interpreted as a complicated allegory. If I had to compare this film to the work of other filmmakers, the only names I could mention would be those of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Peter Greenaway. Polaco uses theatrical settings and revolving camera shots to create a haunting atmosphere. Big, old houses like the one where the action takes place abound in the Greater Buenos Aires area, and they are ideal settings for stories of isolation, madness, and dark desires. The film is punctuated by three recurring, and quite adequate, musical pieces: &quot;Que Sera, Sera,&quot; &quot;La Vie En Rose,&quot; and Erik Satie&#39;s &quot;Gnossienne No. 1.&quot;A cinematic nightmare, _Kindergarten_ remains the only film to have been banned in Argentina after the return of democracy in the early 80s. It is not for everyone, but it is worth a try. To understand where the film comes from, I recommend watching it back to back with Polaco&#39;s first feature film, the grotesque _Diapasón_. (For a more accessible introduction to the director, there is _Siempre es difícil volver a casa_.

best known for the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, and also Rango, The Ring, and The Mexican, so &quot;quietly understated&quot; is not really his thing, If the Pirates movies are kind of a throwback to old Hollywood swashbucklers, this is a more lurid version of old Gothic suspense thrillers like &quot;Rebecca&quot; or &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau.&quot;The main character is Lockhart (Dane DeHaan), who is the exact sort of morally bankrupt young financial hotshot you&#39;ve seen in a bunch of other movies. His bosses are so cartoonishly evil that they may as well be counting wads of cash as they tell him he&#39;s being sent off to Europe to fetch a wayward executive whose signature is needed to allow a merger to go forth so as to allow them to rake in more millions. (Oddly, a similar plot undergirds the otherwise-completely different Will Smith vehicle &quot;Collateral Beauty.&quot;)Most of the rest of the movie takes place in a Swiss Alps sanitarium where practically everything looks like it&#39;s from some time in the first half of the last century. I half expected John Harvey Kellogg to show up, but instead we get Volmer (Jason Isaacs), the place&#39;s director. As with the patients and the staff, there&#39;s something not quite right about the overly affable man, and the impatient Lockhart has plenty of time to figure it out after an accident delays his trip back to New York.Exactly what&#39;s going on, and why no one ever seems to leave the place, takes quite a while (almost 2.5 hours) to unspool, but Verbinski successfully distracts the viewer with visually arresting images of hallways, of peacefully exercising old people, of slithery fish, of living and maybe dead bodies in all shapes and sizes (but mostly white and old), and so on. A teen girl (aptly named Mia Goth), the only young person besides Lockhart, may hold some clues. Rather than a lush island, the sanitarium is high on a mountain, but the effect is the same, as if the viewer has been transported to a world apart.Does this all sound good? Then you&#39;ll probably like this very dark fable. The deep mystery of why the place is so strange is possibly layered with too much complication. I think everything fits together pretty well, but I&#39;m not positive. I am positive that this is definitely going to be a lot different than anything else in the multiplex whenever you might choose to see it.","An ambitious young executive is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an idyllic but mysterious ""wellness center"" at a remote location in the Swiss Alps.

The positives are the running time is short, even though the film feels excruciatingly long. The image quality is decent, even though everything happening behind and in front of the camera is utterly worthless. A group of teenagers staying at a cabin in the woods is the ideal set-up for a low budget horror film, but this movie literally gets everything wrong because it doesn&#39;t know what it wants to be. It&#39;s not horror, it&#39;s just horrific. The actors are not performers, at least not very convincing ones. And the filmmakers are not storytellers, at least not very cohesive ones. Even the film&#39;s title &quot;Honeycomb,&quot; which sounds intriguing and promising, is ruined the moment you see it on screen in a shockingly cheap and bad stop-motion opening title sequence using Play-Doh. And the film only gets worse from there.","In the mundane hours of early summer, five girls sulk in their own boredom waiting for something. When Willow (Sophie Bawks-Smith) stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned cabin, she begins fantasizing about the life she and the girls could have there. Leader (Destini Stewart), Jules (Jillian Frank), Vicky (Mari Geraghty), and Millie (Rowan Wales) pack their bags and whisper a quick goodbye to the life they knew. They flow through open fields, blissfully entering their new sun-soaked world. Director Avalon Fast's new film ""Honeycomb"" is a way of feeling. A slow mindless space has been written with borderless rules and time to fill. The girls push for a meaning that is hardly there, struggling to reach out, grab it, and lock it in a box.

That said, track down the originals since they are all available on video in widescreen, subtitled editions. The cinematography will make you drool, and the swordfighting is probably the most impressive samurai-type swordwork ever put on film. Another plus is Lone Wolf, played by Tomisaburo Wakayama. Casting him for a handsome comic book hero is not what would come to mind immediately, but it is his middle-aged dumpiness that makes him utterly believeable during his fight scenes. Swordfight fans, you will reach Nirvana during this orgy of carnage! For a more impressive display of Wakayama&#39;s skills, check out LIGHTNING SWORDS OF DEATH (frequently found in rental shops as LUPINE WOLF), the third film in the Lone Wolf series which was actually released in the states six years before SHOGUN ASSASSIN during the kung fu movie craze. In LIGHTNING SWORDS, the film remains totally unedited from the original and features a showdown between Lone Wolf and army that is equipped with not just swords, but arrows and rifles as well!!!","Long ago there was a great samurai warrior who served his Shogun honorably. The Shogun however grew paranoid as he became more and more senile. The Shogun sought to destroy all those who might stand to oppose his rule, and so he sent his ninja spies to the samurai's home. The ninjas failed to kill the samurai, but did kill his beloved wife. From then on, the samurai swore on his honor to seek out the Shogun and avenge the death of his love.

But his methods come under the eyes of the boys, with his constant testing of the young, inexperienced lad Alan. But soon enough we find the tables are eventually turned around on just who relies on each other.&#39;White Water Summer&#39; is a respectably bold and hearty, if unspectacular presentation that Ernest Kinoy and Manya Starr&#39;s actively mediative and theme-grown material feels unsure to what it truly wants to be, as it treads between feel-good adventure, psycho-territory and being morally hounded in finding the mental toughness to go beyond your limitations and fears. Jeff Bleckner&#39;s direction is well-measured and slickly handled, as the standouts range from the excellent white water rafting scenes and rock climbing views. The harrowing tension within these passages seem to bubble, but Bleckner also gets a great bunch of performances, especially from his young confident cast (Sean Astin, Jonathan Ward, K.C. Martel and Matt Adler) who show binding chemistry. That when a change in Bacon&#39;s character begins to show, the suspense and dangerous air kicks in the adrenaline as the boys begin to feel the circumstances change. Astin is impressive as Alan, as he goes head on with stupendously hard-pressed Kevin Bacon. His way is the right ways don&#39;t question it. As he goes on to test them out individually and as a team to become dependant on one and each other. But does it become beyond breaking point to get these results.What I could have done without was the flash-forward smart-mouth laced narration pockets of an older Sean Astin talking to the screen, while cutting between the central story. They somewhat lessen the impact and became off-putting. Even the soundtrack with its squealing rock tunes became a little overbearing, as it regularly pumped it out. Michael Boddicker&#39;s soothing original score does a better job in camouflaging with its surroundings and activities. John Alcott&#39;s striking cinematography naturally hovers over the beautiful backdrop getting amongst organic growth and swirling waters to isolate the viewers along with the small party.","An experienced guide (Vic) accompanies a city boy (Alan) and his three friends on their first wilderness experience.

This is a very good movie that is worth watching, but it also a tad bit generic and cookie cutter like. Most romantic comedies are though so going in I expected that. Sudeikis is great and funny as always, even though this is more serious than we are used to from him. In terms of romantic movies this is one that men will like, maybe more than women. Overall, a movie that I did like but was almost a little too cookie cutter like to be considered original.

I think most of the sub 5 star reviews have seen the thriller tag and thought that was what they were going to get. This is a serious drama about child abuse and how it can affect everything and everyone around you and is a brave movie if I may say that.
If you are feeling depressed or are expecting something else then I would walk away now and find something else to watch. You definitely have to be in a certain mood to watch this and take it in properly.The acting from the entire cast was superb especially Alex Pettyfer who carried the movie and directed it but also a scintillating performance from Nicola Peltz and Hala Finley.The subject is a serious one about child abuse in America and I think how widespread it is around the entire world and gives one pause for thought and to ask questions of the audience which is a good thing. However if you are not in the mood I do not think you will find this an enjoyable experience as it will leave you with a good few dark questions and is not conducive to alleviating your mood if you are in any way feeling down or depressed.That said its a brave subject to tackle and make a movie about knowing full well that 80% of audiences will not like it and prefer the crash, bang, wallop that society seems to focus on these days which is a shame.","""Back Roads"" centers on a young man stuck in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters after the shooting death of his abusive father and the arrest of his mother.

So it was perhaps inevitable that I would enjoy Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising&#39;s &#39;Sinkin&#39; in the Bathtub&#39; since it is the first ever Looney Tune(not counting the short pilot film &#39;Bosko The Talk Ink Kid&#39;). Animated by the great Friz Freleng, &#39;Sinkin&#39; in the Bathtub&#39; is surprisingly enjoyable on its own merits. It quickly establishes a bawdier atmosphere than previous cartoons (completely naked characters, a dance involving toilet paper, a shot of a bra and a cow with an enormous, pendulous udder) which would come to characterise Warner Bros. animation. It also establishes a sense of enormous inventiveness instantly when lead character Bosko plays his shower like a harp. The subsequent story is thin on plot (Bosko visits his girlfriend Honey and they go for a drive encountering some very mild danger) but there are plenty of funny moments, my favourite being Bosko&#39;s anthropomorphic car unexpectedly emerging for a distant shed instead of the garage. If the short ever tends towards the dull, there&#39;s always the sense of &quot;I&#39;m watching the first ever Looney Tune&quot; to get you through the weak patches, Surprisingly, these are few and far between (Bosko crying after a goat eats his flowers is a little saccharine but otherwise there&#39;s little that comes to mine) and while there was still a long way to go before the recognised Warner style was achieved, &#39;Sinkin&#39; in the Bathtub&#39; is a charming start to a truly great story. Bosko&#39;s climactic intonation of the soon to be iconic phrase &#39;That&#39;s All Folks&#39; will surely floor any animation fanatic.","The film opens with Bosko whistling in his bathtub as the shower fills it with water. The song, appropriately, is ""Singin' in the Bathtub."" He plucks his toes and his nose to make musical sounds. He even plays the streams of water as if they were harp strings. The bathtub gets into the act, by rising on its feet and dancing around the bathroom, waving a bath towel and throwing sheets of toilet paper into the air as if they were flower petals. Bosko drives his anthropomorphic car to the home of his girlfriend, Honey. The two go for a ride, but the way is blocked by a haughty cow. Bosko pushes her body down under her legs, which stick up like tent poles, and drives over her. All is sunny and bright for Bosko and Honey until they lose control of the car. This event leads to more calamities, including Honey getting trapped in a runaway bathtub on wheels. Only the happy pair's good luck can save the day. —J.

I became obsessed with this voice that sounded as if it could crack and fall apart from pain in one moment, and then soar the next.But try finding video of Dalton.Thankfully filmmakers Peete and Yapkowitz do that for us. What we have here is a truly stunning documentary that somehow, with no Karen Dalton to interview, gives us a very complete portrait of a complex and brilliant artist.Using singer Angel Olsen to bring Dalton&#39;s poetry to life is a stroke of genius. The people in her life who tell her story, are honest and caring. The look of the film, as if it were found in some old box that had been sitting on a closet shelf for 5 decades perfectly matches the tone, the subject. And the live performances of Dalton that they have managed to find will take your breath away.As someone who has made 5 (going on 6) music documentaries, I tend to be very hard on them. But IN MY OWN TIME was very easy to fall in love with. Like it&#39;s subject&#39;s voice, it is damn near perfect.(Saw this at DOC NYC 2020 film festival.)","Blues and folk singer Karen Dalton was a prominent figure in 1960s New York.

While there is a sameness to some of them (true of virtually any western series--especially when you watch more than one of them each day!), on the whole they are a quality lot and, to me, the last GREAT b-movie series Westerns. By the late 40&#39;s, many of the western actors and crew members were probably available for work inexpensively, and Monogram put many of them to work in this series. As many of the films featured similar supporting casts, different films would feature some of them and in other films those same actors would have small walk-on roles not even credited in the beginning titles. Virtually EVERY supporting actor in these films is a western veteran who is a pleasure to watch. When people the stature of Lyle Talbot and John Hart are in a film and NOT listed in the opening credits, you know you&#39;ve got a solid cast. Brown was always one of the best actors in b-westerns (check his early credits to see some of the major stars with whom he worked and held his own), and at this point in his career he had a depth and warmth and gravitas that commanded attention and respect, yet he lacked the aloof quality of a Tim McCoy and seemed approachable. The under-rated Jimmy &quot;Shamrock&quot; Ellison joined Brown in a number of Monograms, and he&#39;s fine here as a new sheriff with a secret. I. Stanford Jolley is superb as a grizzled robber with a link to Ellison that Ellison wishes he could forget. There are a number of genuinely emotional scenes involving Ellison and Brown, and the plot is quite clever (the story, incidentally, was written by actor Myron Healey!). The dozens of Johnny Mack Brown &quot;Monogram&quot; westerns are a fine body of work that can still be enjoyed today...when I&#39;m watching one and my children wander into the room, they usually wind up staying for the rest of the film.","As he dies from the wounds received from the Morrow outlaw gang, the sheriff of King City, Texas hands his badge to his deputy, Tod Merrick ('James Ellison').

It follows five people wandering through NYC on election night in 2008, all attempting to understand their pasts in order to make peace with the present. The film is built around three former members of an early 90s hip-hip group, that seemed to have some underground credibility, but never released a full length album. The film is purely dialog, with the actors carrying the film. Drumming opts for a fairly intimate cinematography, with closes up dominating the running time. His direction was hit and miss, at times the camera work aided in creating a sense of intimacy, as the characters work through their lives. At other times, Drumming&#39;s staging feels amateurish and contrived, fearful of movement.The parts of the movie that drew me in the most revolved around John or Big Words (played Dorian Missick) and Annie (Yaya Alafia) who I think gave the most engaging performances. Additionally, Drumming&#39;s best work is inside Annie&#39;s small apartment, the film felt the most at ease during these sequences. I found myself increasingly disinterested in Terry or DJ Malik (Darien Sills-Evans), a character I struggled to related with. While some issues raised are more specific to the African-American community (and probably somewhat specific to NYC), the film deals at its core with universal human themes, of lost youthful dreams and how awkward, confusing, difficult, and even scarring the transition into traditional adulthood is. A good film to sit and reflect with.","Members of a once-promising hip-hop group, now in their late 30's, struggle with regret, disappointment, and change on Election Night 2008.Members of a once-promising hip-hop group, now in their late 30's, struggle with regret, disappointment, and change on Election Night 2008.",""

The short revolves around a pudgy, everyman who works a mundane desk job and is tasked with compiling the most significant events, people, and movements for a hard drive that will be preserved by other galaxies once a missile strikes Earth and the entire planet explodes. The hard drive can only fit so much, and the man must find a way to incorporate everything he possibly can onto said hard drive, even if that means shortchanging people like Orson Welles and lumping Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman in as one person. The man is deeply reclusive, not saying much to his clueless wife, who spends her days trying to perfect her recipe for catfish, and must keep Earth&#39;s demise and his project a secret from everyone he knows.Britto creates in a mere five minutes all the anxiety and loneliness that would likely span from creating a project like this. For starters, we look at our protagonist and how lonely he is, never saying much and constantly immersed in his work physically or mentally. The exhaustion takes a toll on him and he can&#39;t bring himself to focus on much else, but then again, how could he when he knows something so catastrophic and is obligated not to tell another soul? Secondly, there&#39;s the element of singling out and emphasizing parts of human history that make you question what you&#39;d include on such a hard drive if you were given this insurmountable task.Overtime, the man begins to think about his life, his wife, his own personal experiences, his first love, the girls he has kissed, the classes he has took, the memories he has made, and so on, and questions if his and the memories of numerous others are significant enough to make the hard drive? Is it really fair that such memories be floating invisibly around a radioactive wasteland after Earth&#39;s imminent demise? Yearbook is a short to ponder long after the credits roll, and its simple yet beautiful animation is one of the many things to draw you into a story so depressing but so thought-provoking on human and historical levels.You can view Yearbook on AOL Video, http://on.aol.com/video/yearbook-by-bernardo-britto-518563592 Directed by: Bernardo Britto.","A man is hired to compile the definitive history of human existence before the planet blows up.A man is hired to compile the definitive history of human existence before the planet blows up.",""

From a technical aspect the cinematography is top-notch, the actors are among Poland&#39;s best, (including the great Boguslaw Linda in the lead role) and the plot is fast paced and entertaining. The themes of this movie lend themselves to a lot of thinking about the role of UN Peacekeeping Forces.During the hight of the Bosnian War, Poland occupied fourth place in the rankings of contributers of military contingents in Yugoslavia even though they had not yet been admitted as a member of NATO. Peacekeeping troops were very limited on what they were allowed to do even when they found themselves or civilians in dangerously grave situations. At the time this movie was made they were often unarmed. It is important to point out that at the time of this film&#39;s release, the war in Yugoslavia was reaching a point of conflict not seen in Europe since the Second World War, and human rights violations including &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; were reaching a level on par with genocide. This movie revolves around a Major in the Polish Army who makes the decision to deliberately disobey UN policy in order to attempt the rescue of fellow Polish soldiers. This decision puts his men in harms way, and some of them are killed because of his decision. However, his decision to violate UN policy allows him to save the live&#39;s of an entire village of people, and isn&#39;t that one reason why Peacekeeping troops should be employed? In the end the bad guys lose. Winning wasn&#39;t easy, nor was it achieved without sacrifice. Success primarily came about because someone decided to get tough. To me, the movie gave a clear message that the UN needed to take more of a &quot;get tough&quot; policy regarding the Bosnian Crisis, especially in the matter of how much force can be used to protect civilians.It is interesting to note several events that happened within a year of this films release. One, Poland was admitted as a member of NATO. Two, the UN changed their policies and rules of engagement governing the use of force allowing peacekeepers &quot;to use all necessary means&quot; to protect civilians in their immediate vicinity and prevent violence against UN staff and personnel. Third, the US and NATO intervened with a more forceful approach that caused Yugoslavia to cease it&#39;s conflict. This is one of the few movies I have seen that dealt with current (current when the film was made) military issues not made in the USA. I found it fascinating to see a film that expressed viewpoints regarding peacekeeping from another country.Granted, it may not compare to some of Hollywood&#39;s military blockbusters, but this is a well-made thought-provoking movie. I wish I had discovered it years ago. I highly recommend it.","In Bosnia a squad of peacekeeping soldiers ignores orders and sets off to save the crew of a crashed helicopter.In Bosnia a squad of peacekeeping soldiers ignores orders and sets off to save the crew of a crashed helicopter.",""

Still get much enjoyment out of them now as a young adult, even if there are more interesting in personality cartoon characters and better overall cartoons.That is in no way knocking Woody, because many of his cartoons are a lot of fun to watch and more and also still like him a lot as a character, agree completely that neither him or his cartoons should ever be forgotten. As far as the Woody Woodpecker/Wally Walrus cartoons go, there are better, like one of my favourite overall Woody Woodpecker cartoons &#39;Ski For Two, but it&#39;s still great. Woody since being partnered with Wally has been much more appealingly designed from when he was still evolving and feels fully formed in terms of personality as a character.Perhaps there are characters with more interesting personalities, but Woody is still at his best incredibly funny, never obnoxious, increasingly manic and very lovable self. Agree with the impish child comparison summing up Woody&#39;s behaviour here.Wally is a great foil and works so well with Woody. One also feels sorry for poor Wally, but at the same time one cannot hate on Woody.As ever, the animation is great. Woody&#39;s character design and physicality have changed/evolved for the better. Even more impressive are the rich and vibrant colours, the meticulously detailed backgrounds and the quite smooth drawing.Can&#39;t praise the music enough either, characterful energy, dynamic, action enhancing and lushly orchestrated.Nor the razor sharp and witty dialogue, the bright and breezy pacing without being rushed and some hilarious gags. Plus some typically good voice acting. All of which more than make up for a story that&#39;s on the slight and formulaic side.Overall, another great Woody Woodpecker effort. 9/10 Bethany Cox","A newspaper announces that Ivan Awfulitch, the famous ambassador, is due to have a barbecue with local resident Wally Walrus.

Thrown out of their biological homes, black and Latino queers find and congregate in new &quot;houses,&quot; led by an elder (or &quot;house parent&quot;) and then compete in periodic competitions, dancing and vogueing down their own runways in outrageous costumes, often simulating their own version of the outer world, judged by their own peers. As a result, a newer, much stronger family is formed where everyone is accepting of their differences and they are able to operate at a level disallowed in mainstream society. This movement is responsible for giving birth to the idea of the pop star, including, but not limited to, such icons as Madonna, Lady Gaga (&quot;&#39;House&#39; of Gaga&quot; borrows the term from these ad hoc homes/teams) and Beyonce&#39;s alter- ego Sasha Fierce. Much like the music industry co-opted black R &amp; B in the 1950&#39;s and popularized the form by concocting Elvis Presley, most of these ladies owe a great part of their success to this subculture.The story concerns Bradley Darnell Lyle (the talented Ephraim Sykes), a black queer youth, thrown out by his mother Deondra (Metra Dee along with her fingernails are hilarious at first, before the low-budget laughs give way to the stone-cold reality of how heartless the mother is). He takes off in her car and gives &quot;meet cute&quot; a new definition when Carter (well-cast Andre Myers) crosses his path. Their exchange is indicative of how truly smart and sly Glenn Gaylord&#39;s (who also wrote the songs) screenplay is. From there, Bradley slowly immerses himself in the world of ball culture, meeting all kinds of characters along the way, including his house mother Queef Latina (Barbie-Q, who can threaten to stick her foot up anyone&#39;s ass with the best of them) and Eppie Durall (James Alsop almost steals the whole show) who wants nothing more than to give birth to her children.The more upbeat songs are generally stronger than the slower ones. Princess Eminence (a divinely bitchy Phillip Evelyn, who also gives a heartfelt performance) gets to sing the toe- tapping &quot;Justin&#39;s Gonna Call,&quot; explaining to Bradley that greener pastures await. And &quot;Knock Them Mothafuckers Down&quot; is a driving bowling-alley number about kicking ass and taking names that makes a catchy companion piece to the film&#39;s self-titled theme. While the movie doesn&#39;t quite properly weave Caldwell Jones (Demarkes Dogan as Queef Latina&#39;s lover) into the story, his rap duet with Carter, &quot;This Is My Lament,&quot; achieves an odd beauty. &quot;I&#39;m Willing&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t Jump Baby&quot; didn&#39;t ring any tears, but &quot;His Name Is Shawn,&quot; about the perception of and fight for identity of transgender and queer youth between the biological families who have ostracized them and the chosen families who have opened their arms to them is astonishing, appropriately awkward and strangely moving. The soundtrack also creates a really cool mash-up between &quot;Ballroom Bliss&quot; and Bradley&#39;s self-pitying &quot;Loser&#39;s List.&quot; Like 1970&#39;s Blaxploitation, there are some rough edges which work to the film&#39;s advantage. It&#39;s painfully obvious that the actors sing to their own vocals (a common practice in musicals that is less apparent in higher-budgeted affairs), but it&#39;s unimportant and hardly distracting. To an outsider, at first, the Los Angeles ball culture may appear narcissistic and superficial. People prance down their runways, gesticulating and shooting irreverent poses, while being cheered on and/or booed in the process, all of which this attitude spreads into their respective homes. Yet, we eventually bear witness to talented dancers and contortionists, as well as the time and creativity which the artists invest into their costumes and makeup, but, ultimately, most importantly, the resilient fabric stitching these untraditional families together.Floor is both a celebration of a marginalized culture which has been around for ages and developed out of a Darwinian instinct to exist and thrive, but its songs and sass beg for audience participation. Its flamboyance and musical revelry create an experience not unlike The Rocky Horror Picture Show, although I could be deathly wrong, as no one else immediately around me was bopping their head to the beats. This may have just been another indication of my square white boyness. Still, if this film could achieve a small fraction of the popularity and response of Rocky&#39;s, it would certainly be a respectable reflection of where our society is at today, especially considering the quality level is on par with modern classic Hedwig and the Angry Inch.http://goo.gl/Lb2wL","Our African-American hero , Brad is bullied by his dysfunctional mom; he flees his home and by chance tumbles down the rabbit-hole into the LA ball scene where he finds a ragtag new famiiy.

It&#39;s unmistakable for anything else and that means if you liked his previous work in &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot; you&#39;ll be familiar with the style of horror and rock opera presented in this short film, so you&#39;ll enjoy it a lot. The plot? Well I can&#39;t say I can really recall it very well and some of It is because it&#39;s confusing at times. I remember a lot of cool visuals, some similarities with Aesop&#39;s fables, demons, knife-throwing, Bill Moseley in makeup and Alexa Vega looking pretty sexy. In all honesty it&#39;s not my fault, this is a picture that you kind of need to watch more than once.While the songs aren&#39;t as polished as the ones in his previous work, the sets and costumes are impressive and for a low budget production, it looks great. I found the story to be scrambled though, which frustrated me because I love the idea of this demonic carnival (and I&#39;ve always wanted to see it done well since I saw &quot;We&#39;re Back! A Dinosaur&#39;s Story). The upside is that if you like it, the picture is short so you&#39;ll be able to watch it multiple times to clarify the confusing bits. Similarly, it&#39;s a lot of style over substance and if at first you don&#39;t really care for it, it&#39;s just not your thing. It&#39;s a love it, or hate it kind of thing and I bet the way to really appreciate It would be to view it with someone who&#39;s already fallen In love with it and can clarify some of the plot elements or give you factoids on all of those cool little details. I enjoyed it enough that I think you should check it out, if only to see If It will be your kind of thing.

overall experience of this is just slightly inferior. This one suffers mainly under not having such an entertaining villain/main monster as the first one; Lilith does have some decent lines, but almost all of them were sexual innuendos, which gets old a little too fast. The Collector was more entertaining, with his cynical and sarcastic personality. There&#39;s also less &quot;action&quot; in this one, though there might be slightly more gore. In this one, the plot also moves along a little too slowly, considering the fact that it&#39;s only meant as entertainment; with that in mind, you have to wonder why it takes so long to tell the story and get to the gore and blood. The ending sequence was also slightly less entertaining and exciting than the one in Demon Knight. Like Demon Knight, the film manages to bring in plenty of both sex and violence, often both at the same time. Apart from Rafe(Dennis Miller), there weren&#39;t really any interesting or entertaining characters. Miller does a really great job, portraying the type of character he usually does; a slimy, sarcastic jerk. That is the Miller that we fans know and love. It&#39;s nice to see him in a role that compliments his talents so well. The film, like Demon Knight, is very gory and violent, although apart from the Crypt Keepers puns, and some of Miller&#39;s lines, this didn&#39;t have that much to offer. It&#39;s good enough to watch, if you&#39;ve got 90 minutes to kill, and you don&#39;t want to see Demon Knight, don&#39;t want to re-watch it, or can&#39;t find it. The films are both worth watching, but I&#39;d suggest Demon Knight over this one. I recommend it(like the first) to fans of gory horror films, and people who just want to be entertained for 90 minutes without having to think very much. 6/10","The old bag of bones 'Cryptkeeper' returns for his second full length feature flick about a funeral home that's a front for a whorehouse run by vampires. —Humberto AmadorThe old bag of bones 'Cryptkeeper' returns for his second full length feature flick about a funeral home that's a front for a whorehouse run by vampires. —Humberto Amador","$13,000,000.00"

The story revolves around the doings of egg collectors (or &quot;oologists&quot; as they sometimes call themselves), a breed of men which I, in common with most ornithologists, struggle to understand; if, as they claim, they are motivated by a love of nature, why do they persist in endangering through their activities the very creatures they profess to love? J.P. Whittier, an obsessive and very wealthy egg collector, is trying to obtain specimens of the eggs of a newly discovered (and fictitious) subspecies of the bald eagle. In reality there are two existing subspecies of this bird, the northern and the southern, although the supposed new variety is said to be larger than either. At the time the film was made in 1984 the bald eagle was on the brink of extinction in the continental United States, although its numbers have since recovered and it was removed from the list of endangered species in 2007.Whittier is well aware that stealing its eggs will be likely to push the new subspecies closer to extinction, but is nevertheless determined to proceed with his scheme. Because the only known nest is on top of a lofty crag, he hires rock climber Mike Walker to steal the eggs for him. Although Walker can no more comprehend Whittier&#39;s motivation than I can, he is tempted by the huge sum of money he is offered. There is, however, a problem. The nest is on land owned by Jim Malden, a reclusive and eccentric conservationist who fiercely guards both his privacy and the wildlife on his land, going so far as to attack hunters with a crossbow when he catches them poaching. To allay Malden&#39;s suspicions, Walker poses as a photographer. Turner plays Stella Clayton, a local storekeeper in whom both men are romantically interested. Stella is presumably a widow or divorcée, as she has a young son, Adam. Turner may have taken the part in order to try and play down the &quot;femme fatale&quot; image she had acquired after &quot;Body Heat&quot;.&quot;Variety&quot; magazine accused the film of lacking dramatic tension or emotional involvement, and there is justice in the accusation. The main villain of the piece is Whittier, and he always keeps well away from the action. Walker, even at the beginning of the film, never seems very villainous, and by the end he is not a villain at all, having been converted to the conservationist cause by Jim and Stella. Malden is not always entirely sympathetic, seeming at times too fanatical and obsessive; putting a crossbow bolt through someone&#39;s leg is not generally regarded as the act of a Christian gentleman, even if done in an ostensibly good cause.The plot does not always flow very smoothly and there is, apparently, a reason for this. After filming had been completed, one of four reels of film went missing and the director Philippe Mora had, somehow, to put a coherent story together from the remaining three. Despite some attractive shots of the North Carolina scenery, &quot;A Breed Apart&quot; is a routine action thriller which is not always very thrilling, but given its strange history the finished product could have been much worse. 5/10","Jim Malden (Rutger Hauer), a Vietnam veteran who has lost his wife and child, lives as a recluse on an island full of rare birds. His only contacts with humanity are with Stella Clayton (Kathleen Turner) and her young son Adam (Andy Fenwick), who have a small supply store on the mainland. One day, a mountain climber named Mike Walker (Powers Boothe) brings a visit to the island to observe two rare eagles. What he doesn't tell Jim is that he's hired by an egg collector to steal the eagles' eggs.

The viewer can expect to see a lot of action in any Rocky Lane move and this one is no exception. Usually the stories for the Rocky Lane westerns were well written without becoming too complicated for a juvenile audience. The story for &quot;Salt Lake Raiders,&quot; however, tends to ramble and one suspects it was stretched out to cover an approximately one hour-time slot. The story would have been much better whittled down to about 30 minutes, which would have made for a very good TV show. The interplay between Rocky and Nugget Clark is as good as ever. I could never quite understand why Rocky and Nugget were re-introduced in each Rocky Lane movie. But this also tends to be believable in most instances. Roy Barcroft is on hand as usual as the meanest of the bad guys, a part he played so well. Blackjack does his thing as he usually does in any Rocky movie and Rocky appears in his usual undercover marshal guise. The viewer may also wonder where the title &quot;Salt Lake Raiders&quot; comes from since most of the movie takes place in and around a ghost town, but then most of the Saturday matinée cowboy movies have titles that have very little to do with the story, at times no more than a title to one of the songs in the movie if it is a singing cowboy picture. I highly recommend any Rocky Lane movie to those who like this type of entertainment.","Brit Condor's vicious gang was driving out the citizens of Silver City with unrelenting raids and robberies.

Liked the account of actor Alan Alda&#39;s telling of his dad-Robert Alda&#39;s-experience as a singer and straight man there. Also was touched with Chris Costello-daughter of Lou Costello-and her account of her dad&#39;s tragedy of having his infant son drowning while he was supposed to do his radio show which he did despite that happening especially when they showed the baby&#39;s picture. And then there&#39;s the audio of one Blaze Starr-the woman who was once involved with my state&#39;s (Louisiana) governor Earl Long-who died last June. The interviews seem to have a haphazard quality as it goes from one tangent to another. Still, Ms. Zemeckis has nothing to be ashamed about in covering this long-neglected subject of this part of the entertainment world from days gone by being recorded now. So on that note, Behind the Burly Q is highly recommended.","An impressive number of veteran strippers are interviewed here, offering their memories. Also on hand are Lou Costello's daughter, and Alan Alda.

I wish that this documentary had mentioned that Robert Alda later had a more prestigious career in Hollywood films and Broadway musicals.

It left me longing for Newly Single 2.","American filmmaker Adam Christian Clark directs and stars in this jet-black comedy centered around the LA dating scene, as a self-obsessed filmmaker who finds himself on the market once again. The film is darkly funny and sometimes brutal. After ridiculing his girlfriend, director Astor Williams Stevenson finds himself single and trying to discover what exactly he wants. At the same time, he attempts to get a film off the ground and soon learns that his creative vision will not align with that of his crew. As Astor goes on a number of dates, his abrasiveness and cynical attitude towards life seems to become ever more crystallized. The film's centerpiece is a fearless performance from Clark as he embodies a man whose self-loathing is hidden by arrogance. Yet, for all his bluff and bluster Clark manages to add a sheen of vulnerability to make Astor a compelling and sympathetic character. While the film is reminiscent of great American cinema of the 1970s (with some slight echoes of the works of Woody Allen) with a somewhat staccato structure made up of disparate moments, this is still a thoroughly modern affair replete with some graphic sexuality and an often-harsh takedown on modern views of dating. Despite its moments of cynicism, this also manages to be a witty, funny must for all those who appreciate strong voices in American cinema. —Laurence Boyce",""

A good storyline filled with witty one-liners, good comic scenes, great songs, plenty of flesh and of course great action sequences - a perfect recipe for a masala Bollywood action. The pace of the movie is so good that you don&#39;t want to leave your seat. Abshishek&#39;s performance is good - within the boundaries of his can&#39;s and cannot&#39;s. Uday Chopra overacts. John Abraham fits the role to the &quot;T&quot;. Heroines have small roles but oozing with sex-appeal (the action theme demands it - remember?).

The extra castmembers are great and unforgettable.

In fact, after seeing about 6-10 of the cartoons, &quot;Rocketeers&quot; is the first with even an inkling of any personality! Mostly, their cartoons have abounded with singing and dancing.The cartoon begins poorly. A bunch of scientists who talk like Punch n Judy were spewing nonsense words and launched what looked like a firecracker. The firecracker was a dud...only going a few feet and plunging into the sea. Then, Tom &amp; Jerry step out and go exploring under the ocean...finding skeletons (huh??) and mermaids.

This approach of capturing images may impress some, but it does not impress me. What excites me, however, is strong storytelling containing characters worth spending time with and getting to know-which &quot;Ghost,&quot; written and directed by Anthony Z. James, offers the viewer should one bother to look just underneath the familiar plot: an ex-con having just been released from prison wishes to reconnect with his family, specifically his son who grew up without a father for ten years. As the ex-con rings the doorbell, his wife chooses not to answer the door. We assume it is out of fear.It is a quiet drama-certain to be mislabeled by those seeking numbing thrills or noisy action as slow or boring-but lean a little closer and listen with intent. Clearly, the humanistic screenplay aims to make a thoughtful statement about the past, how it can be passed on not just through environment and socioecology but also biology. The father&#39;s past involves violence-which is skirted around for more than half the picture. When specifics are finally revealed, it is not entirely surprising yet still quite disarming. Perhaps it is no accident that the occasionally irascible son walks around the neighborhood with something to prove, as if constantly carrying weight on his shoulders. His father wasn&#39;t around to take off some of the burden.At the center of the picture is two naturalistic performances by Anthony Mark Streeter (Tony, the father) and Nathan Hamilton (Conor, the son). Right when the picture ended, I felt compelled to find out if this was their first feature-not because the acting is in any way unconvincing or false. On the contrary, Streeter and Hamilton&#39;s performances contain no vanity, just raw interactions of every day people who&#39;ve been around the block-perhaps one too many times. They look tired, a bit sad, hopeful at times, and when they are surprised, especially when they try to hide it, we cannot help but smile with them. The relationship&#39;s rhythm is so curious, I found myself observing the most minute facial details of two men who have just entered a new chapter of their lives.A standout: when the father and son make eye contact for the first time, not saying a word for what it feels like ages, we are made to believe that these two already have a complicated history; it is exciting because we are dropped right in the middle of it. Acceptance or rejection-we are not given a solid grasp of how the relationship will turn out. Another standout: Tony meeting with a man with whom he used to work for. Dom (Russell Barnett) seems to have the money, the power, the drugs. He wears a nice suit. But really look at him, his habits, his dead eyes. All he has is a nice view from his office window. Tony might be a penniless ex-con but at least he has a purpose. He wants to live again, to be present, to be there.The final act may come across contrived to some. To me, however, it is a natural destination-not just in a movie of this type but also in terms of what this specific story attempts to communicate about the cycle of violence, how ghosts of the past can haunt and threaten to derail a possible future of contentment and happiness. I admired that it faded to black when it did because it trusts us, after having gotten the chance to know its protagonists, to imagine what might happen next. I found it to be a terrific litmus test of how closely we pay attention to the people around us. Here is a movie that gives people the desire to see.","A debut feature shot entirely on an iPhone follows a grizzled ex-con on his first day of freedom as he struggles to reconnect with his family, racing against his sinister past threatening to catch up with him. A gritty and atmospheric London-set drama dives into the complexities of the father-son relationship in the light of toxic masculinity and burden of responsibility.A debut feature shot entirely on an iPhone follows a grizzled ex-con on his first day of freedom as he struggles to reconnect with his family, racing against his sinister past threatening to catch up with him.

It&#39;s not clear, at least to me, what the two girls were told when they asked why their mother was out of the house every night until after midnight, but that&#39;s only one of the many plot holes in this film. The acting isn&#39;t up to much, either - especially Moira Lynd, who plays the younger daughter, and who leaves a hole in the screen every time she appears - but then the hackneyed script and clumsy direction don&#39;t give the actors an awful lot to work with.

They do their best, but it fails to carry the movie.I liked the script though. Sometimes relationships aren&#39;t a clean breakup where people just decide that they want to be out. There&#39;s indecision, better the devil you know, maybe it&#39;s not so bad after all, the uneasy feelings of breaking it off permanently. This film encapsulates all of that. It does feel a bit repetitive for all the breaking up and getting back together, but it&#39;s perfectly captured.Hated the direction! Inexplicable moves from colour to black-and-white, weird camera angles, lighting changes, jumping from one shot to the next. I suppose it was meant to feel jarring and analogous to the relationship being portrayed, but it was super annoying and discombobulating for the viewer. Ultimately this is the thing that made me give this film such a low rating. It felt like the director was trying to be edgy (in a very 90s way) but it did not work at all.Not a great movie. I wished I liked it a lot more, but unfortunately the pieces just don&#39;t fit.","Monica teaches, Steve's a photographer. They've dated more than two years.

While most of Ho&#39;s movies are pretty bad, and some are spectacularly dreadful, he occasionally turns out something so insane that it actually proves to be a lot of fun. This is one such film.The incredibly dumb plot sees three hotel telephonists overhearing conversations between bad guys who are planning to monopolise the hotel industry by any means, including murder. As the trio endeavour to foil the plot, with a little help from a fat friend called Fatty and a fashionista named Alex, members of the purple ninja clan battle the baddies&#39; warriors, the black ninjas and some hopping vampires.Along the way we are treated to such craziness as an assassination attempt by pig carcass (the dead porker chucked from the roof of a tall building), the fit blonde female red ninja doing a spot of stretching and sunbathing in a bikini (only for her to be interrupted by a vampire hiding underneath her beach towel), numerous cross-eyed people (because that&#39;s always hilarious), random ghosts, loads of ninja fighting with coloured paint bombs and fireworks up the sleeve, two boat-hand zombies with stretchy arms, lots of bizarre comedy (including a prolonged scene aboard a boat that features a gag involving the urine of a virgin), purple ninja scuttling along the ground like a beetle and walking up tree trunks, a flying decapitated vampire head that explodes, and a boomerang sword.All of this bonkers action means that Vampire Raiders Ninja Queen is one of Ho&#39;s more entertaining efforts, almost rivalling that classic of craptastic ninja cinema, Ninja Terminator (my favourite Ho film to date, but I still have well over a hundred to go!).6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for the hilarious line, &quot;Cut on it.

It&#39;s told from the point of view of their friends who read about it in the Broadway gossip column of Henny Backus and the influence of that other RKO classic Citizen Kane is unmistakable.Mature is a likable enough fellow who is an aspiring playwright on Broadway who likes to gamble and have a good time as well and Simmons is a girl who nurtures him until he gains success. But then being a Broadway success he falls prey to the usual temptations. A really big temptation comes his way in the form of his latest leading lady, husband collecting Monica Lewis.The cast has some real scene stealing character players like George Cleveland, Jane Darwell, Wally Vernon and Dabbs Greer all of whom are part of the lives of Simmons and Mature. They form a real rooting section for this marriage and they all care about the two leads and make you care as well. The story is told mostly through their recollections of how the relationship of Mature and Simmons has developed over the years and you get to know them as good if flawed people, especially Mature.It&#39;s not Citizen Kane hardly, but Affair With A Stranger is a good entertaining drama with a great cast even if the title of the film was probably done to sensationalize the film a bit and get folks to plunk down their money thinking it might be something else. It&#39;s good enough as it is, on its own merits.","When a TV gossip columnist wrongly announces that the marriage between now successful playwright William Blakeley and his wife Carolyn is breaking up, New York friends variously reminisce about how the two met and married.When a TV gossip columnist wrongly announces that the marriage between now successful playwright William Blakeley and his wife Carolyn is breaking up, New York friends variously reminisce about how the two met and married.",""

It&#39;s the only children&#39;s film made by veteran director Mrinal Sen in his entire career. The film depicts how a person&#39;s longings and desire can boomerang on him when it actually gets realized. The cast includes Shekar Chaterji, Surajit Nandi, Sova Sen, Sadhu Meher, Nemai Ghosh and others. The Tagore story is a pure fantasy. Shekar Chaterji, a teacher lives in a village along with his wife (Sova Sen) and his son. He is a strict father. And his son is a mischievous lad. His son&#39;s wayward ways is a constant source of irritation to Shekar Chaterji. Complaints from villagers about his misdeeds keep pouring in. Inspite of his strictness, Shekar Chaterji is unable to keep his son at bay. His son even dares to bunk from the class while he is teaching. His disciplinary actions create a gulf in the family relations. Both his wife and son are at loggerheads with him.The fantasy element creeps into the narrative at this point. The father secretly desires to become youthful, and the son tired of his dad&#39;s constant bickering longs to be a grown-up man! One night, they both have a dream. In their dream, Goddess Ichhapuran appears before them. She grants them a boon. And they ask her for what they have been secretly craving for so long. And lo, very soon as per their wishes, they both undergo changes. Shekar Chaterji gets trapped in his son&#39;s body and becomes young, while his son receives his dad&#39;s outward features. Only their original voices remain with them. This distinguishing feature helps Shekar Chaterji&#39;s wife (Sova Sen) to believe this unbelievable incident when they tell her about it. All hell breaks loose in the village. When the son goes to school, the villagers think it is the father who is attending school. And when he speaks, they find it is the voice of the son. Many villagers began considering them as &#39;ghosts.&#39; An &#39;ojha&#39; is called to drive out the evil spirit. The film provides some uproariously funny sequences. This 70-minute message laden film is quite enjoyable and is a departure from Mrinalda&#39;s usually intense works. Surprisingly, the print of this film made 30 years back was quite good when it was recently telecast on Alpha Bangla (sometime in early 2000).","",""

But it really doesn&#39;t see the Pink Panther series at its best. The story does lack energy at times and is rather routine too. The ending is ironic but not hugely funny and abruptly rounded off. That it may have been a little better with what happens to the characters reversed is a good suggestion. And sadly the best of the gags(the opening scene and the wheezing laugh) are just amusing and little more, on the most part they&#39;re predictable and rather standard. The animation however is very nicely done, simple without being too simplistic, coloured in an elegant way without feeling too over-saturated and there are little signs of half-heartedness or that it was hurried. The characters are well drawn. The music is beautifully scored and catchy, hearing the theme tune you can understand completely why it&#39;s so iconic. Pinky is still his likable and cool self, and even with the scenario he is funny. The support he has support him very well and none of it feels pointless. Overall, decent but not that great sadly. 6/10 Bethany Cox","The Pink Panther is admitted to hospital after he falls on the street by slipping on his own banana peel.

Result is a tedious, stupid porn time-killer.The uncredited mad scientist (same actor played Francia&#39;s father in FAMILY FUN - 1978) sets the tone: he&#39;s a hammy, untalented jerk, balding but with a sizable dick, affecting a Mittel European accent as he proclaims his goal of creating a fabulous clone. His assistant, Eileen Welles (who has trouble reciting her lines in a monotone) sends two clone women Phaedra Grant and Kathy Kaufman to &quot;collect sperm&quot; for the scientist&#39;s big experiment.Rest of the film is by-the-numbers sex footage of unattractive Kaufman and Grant getting guys to ejaculate. Resulting vial of white stuff is slobbered into the mouth of new improved clone Sharon Kane for a non-finish, wherein she seduces the mad doctor. Final reel is out of synch, which the moronic shill writing notes on the back of SWV&#39;s DVD-R box typically found hilarious, but which is merely incompetent.Nothing interesting happens over the course of a very, very long hour, and there are no SPFX, no attempts whatsoever to back up the sci-fi premise. When it comes time, post-sperm ingestion, to re-animate Kane the scientist merely sticks out his arms and declares: &quot;Let there be light&quot; and she come to life. Even the usually reliable Kane, at the beginning of her career, is a drag.This movie bites the big one. Something Weird paired it with an equally horrendous junker SUPERLADY, making for a thematically compatible but unwatchable double bill on Vol. 102 of its Dragon Art Theatre series.","",""

The setting is contemporary and the rustlers use trucks to haul off the cattle. This is the second McCoy movie that I have seen where he disguises himself as a Mexican. Again, he pulls it off. It&#39;s funny but when McCoy is in disguise his personality shines – he smiles more, laughs more and is more animated with fewer of the steely eyed stares. He still never aims his gun when he shoots though. As much as I enjoyed this movie it did not have as interesting a supporting cast as other McCoys I&#39;ve seen. Dave O&#39;Brien was okay but to me, nothing special. Nonetheless, this is a B Western to be on the lookout for as it is highly entertaining.","When Blackton outbids Bill Carson.

Tania","Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), King of the Persians, whose empire now extends from India to Egypt after the defeat of the Babylonians, is holding a celebratory banquet for his people in the citadel of Susa to display his wealth and splendor. When he summons his attractive wife Vashti, to show off her beauty to the guests, the proud queen refuses to come. The king promptly bans her from ever entering his presence again, and gives orders for the most beautiful young virgins in the land to be brought to him. The young Jewess Esther, adopted daughter of her uncle Mordecai, is among the girls selected; they are told to beautify themselves in the royal harem and prepare to spend the night with the king. Esther succeeds in enchanting the king with her extraordinary beauty and charm, and he makes her his queen. The king promotes his loyal subject Haman - whose family is notably anti-Jewish - to the post of first minister of the kingdom. When the Jew Mordecai fails to kneel down before Haman like all the others, Haman's irritation with him is transformed into a deep hatred of the Jewish people. He manages to get the king to pass a law allowing the Jews of all countries to be persecuted and killed on a certain day. In his desperation, Mordecai seeks help from Esther. She places her life at risk by visiting the king without his consent, and then invites him and Haman to dine with her that evening. By revealing her Jewish origins Esther now succeeds in exposing Haman's evil plan to kill the Jews, and in obtaining the king's pardon for her people. Haman is duly hanged on the gallows he had built for Mordecai. Since the royal decree is irreversible, Ahasuerus passes another one allowing the Jews to defend themselves against their enemies, whom they end up by vanquishing. Many Jews now return to the Holy City and begin rebuilding Jerusalem. —Anonymous",""

There&#39;s no fluffy magic or elves or flying reindeer or anything like that. But a much more believable story of a man and how the myth of Santa has grown.Highly recommended to add to your young children&#39;s annual Christmas movie list.","Hundreds of years ago in Lapland, a little boy named Nikolas loses his family in an accident. The villagers decide to look after the orphaned boy together. Once a year - at Christmas - Nikolas moves to a new home. To show his gratitude, Nikolas decides to make toys for the children of the families as good-bye presents. Over the years, Nikolas's former adoptive families become many, and soon almost every house has presents on its doorstep on Christmas morning. At thirteen, Nikolas is sent to live and work with Iisakki, a grumpy old carpenter, who forbids Nikolas to continue making presents for Christmas. Gradually, however, Nikolas wins Iisakki's trust. Together they begin to look after the Christmas traditional that Nikolas has begun. When the aged Iisakki has to leave Nikolas and move away, the tradition of Christmas presents is once again at risk. Thankfully, Nikolas comes up with a solution that brings children joy every Christmas, even continuing to today. —anonymousHundreds of years ago in Lapland, a little boy named Nikolas loses his family in an accident.

It is surprisingly difficult to find big Korean releases with English subtitles, so seeing Jin-Woon Kim&#39;s new film, which i have been looking forward to for well over a year, was a pleasant experience. Unfortunately everyone in the west will have to wait a little longer...As with all of Jin-Woon Kim&#39;s films i have very little criticism to give this film, from its fantastic and totally relentless action opening to the suspenseful ending, i was completely entertained.The cast, as expected from three of South Korea&#39;s most most talented actors were superb with in my opinion exceptionally notable roles from Lee Byun Hun and Song Kang-Ho. Lee Byung Hyun pulls off a villain superbly and fills this role with style and terror without fault. Song Kang-Ho in my opinion is the main force of the film, pulling it along with humour and perhaps the most interesting story as the film progresses. Woo-Sung Jung plays his &#39;good&#39; role well but feels like the character with least depth. The film contains fantastic make-up and costume design, notably in my eyes, Lee Byung Hun&#39;s character, who looked fantastic and the on screen presence of this smart darkly dressed character set against the sandy desert was stunning.The cinematography in this film was superb with plenty of great flying panoramic desert shots, high octane action camera maneuvers, fast cuts and perfect editing as expected from the director of such fantastic action/thriller films.The soundtrack is fun and reminiscent of old western films with a new, modern twist to keep things up to pace. Although the story has been noted as being weak, the film really does not offer itself as an in depth period drama in the first place. The film is exactly what it calls for... Fun, fast and funny entertainment and what you can expect from some of the finest noted stars and workforce in South Korean cinema.","A guksu western.

It follows two brothers who are sent to collect a dangerous bounty in exchange for keeping their family&#39;s home.-This should have been, and could have been, really good. Unfortunately, it was not so.-The story was unique, but the film had so much trouble focusing on the actual story instead of little side-stories all throughout.-The pace was the worth thing about it, because it was excruciating. Nothing happens for most of the film. And when stuff actually happens, the editing is really bad, so yeah. It feels very unsatisfactory.-The acting is fine. It stars James Ransone and Josh Peck, who I thought did a good job, but not a great job.-The main characters are worth rooting for, but there is not much to anyone else in the film.-I don&#39;t remember the music that much, but it was slow.-There were some cool sequences in the film. Some good effects and a few gun fights I enjoyed.-Even with a few cool moments and other elements that are not too bad, the pace of this movie just kills the entertainment factor. Unfortunately, The Timber is not really worth the time.-It has some violence throughout, so probably R, but I do not remember much else in the film. I could be wrong, but I was not really paying attention too much. Because I was bored.","In the wild, snow covered gold fields of Alaska, two brothers embark on a journey to collect a bounty in a desperate attempt to save their home: but what they find along the way is more than they bargained for.In the wild, snow covered gold fields of Alaska, two brothers embark on a journey to collect a bounty in a desperate attempt to save their home: but what they find along the way is more than they bargained for.","$2,100,000.00"

But unfortunately for them, they stumble across a secret government project to create a biological weapon and may have possibly been responsible for releasing it. Can these crazy kids escape before the military shows up to destroy the evidence? I enjoyed the DVD cover (reminded me of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;) but was turned off my the back of the box, claiming this film was from &quot;horror master&quot; Brett Piper. That slogan has been passed around more than Madonna in an NBA locker room and I think if people like Piper insist on using it, there will be absolutely no truth in the words left.There were some other minors issues. I didn&#39;t need to hear &quot;blow our heads off&quot; at least 3 times within ten minutes. That sort of ruins the intensity of the expression. The gunshots (even the real ones) being paint balls was pretty weak -- and what was with the man in the opening scene being infected with warm peanut butter? (This last part, thankfully is improved later in the film.) How did this get a pg-13? There is a fair amount of cursing and more than the &quot;partial nudity&quot; the film suggests. One woman is quite nude all over for a few minutes. Not that I&#39;m complaining -- I just don&#39;t think this could have passed the censors. (Honestly, I don&#39;t think the MPAA ever saw this film and the creators just said they did.) I like when the scientist touches his face and mouth with his gloves after going through such great lengths not to contaminate anything. But what I really liked was the amazingly awesome bacterium creature (which was much cooler and more disgusting then &quot;The Host&quot;). Seriously, this thing made all the bad acting and directing just disappear. Some of the scenes it had were like a cartoon, but a good deal of it was more like &quot;The Blob&quot; but better (and gross -- this thing made me want to vomit).The last third of the film is really funny with the &quot;you better not be (expletive) me&quot; guy, the bureaucrats and the science / physics talk that goes above and beyond the average film (but maybe not far enough). If the first third had the humor and strong dialog the ending had, this whole film would have been pretty amazing. Unfortunately, aside from looking hot and getting naked, the lead actress has no skills that can used in a film.I guess I&#39;d watch this film again. I wasn&#39;t super-excited or heavily pumped about it, and the low production quality made it all rather annoying. But it had redeeming qualities, and I think Piper (though not a &quot;horror master&quot;) may be someone to watch. Or at least his special effects crew is. That, and the guy who played the British-American scientist. I really, really like that guy.","When a handful of friends stumble upon the abandoned building, they come face to face with a biological weapons experiment gone catastrophically wrong.

And even though this is not his best war movie Mitchum shines in this forgotten movie. He plays a infantry colonel stationed with his men in South Korea before the Korean War. The movie has two subplots: Mitchum at war with his men or winning the affection of a UN worker (played by Ann Blyth). He is among the most believable characters I ever saw in a war movie, and that because he is NOT larger than life or hard as nails. Instead he looks like a decent man which everyone could count on. The only problem with the film is that even though it has some light moments (and Mitchum handles them well) it&#39;s very explicit as for some scenes of soldiers injured or killed that look a bit brutal. Not a war movie for the faint of hearth, but still awfully good.","Wartime drama about an idealistic young UN official (Ann Blyth) who finds out about the horrors of war when she falls in love with Colonel Steve Janowski (Robert Mitchum), the officer in charge of evacuating citizens from Korea. —Jonathan Broxton <j.w.broxton@sheffield.ac.uk>Wartime drama about an idealistic young UN official (Ann Blyth) who finds out about the horrors of war when she falls in love with Colonel Steve Janowski (Robert Mitchum), the officer in charge of evacuating citizens from Korea. —Jonathan Broxton <j.w.broxton@sheffield.ac.uk>","$2,181,000.00"

The actress playing Claire is rotoscoped, which is an animation technique that looks both real and animated at the same time, because it&#39;s like tracing over the actual images. It&#39;s a good technique for this type of documentary, because at once it distances you from the actor, yet brings you closer to the person the actor is portraying, and of the age they were when the events took place.In this way the actors explain things using the words of the real person who was being interviewed, and they also appear as characters in the re-enactment of the events. Because it&#39;s rotoscopy, the emotions of the actors carry over and you&#39;re able to relate to their feelings. The rotoscopy also enables the director to place people in the Mall without them actually being there, so there was no need to clear the Mall or to ask for permission to film. And it allows for a special touch when Claire tells of her fiancé.Claire Wilson is the anchor of the story, having been the first one known shot, and also having been 8 months pregnant at the time. She lay out on the concrete of the Mall in front of the tower for over an hour in the August heat, her dead fiancé beside her, helped only by Rita Starpattern, who ran out to help despite the continued sniping.Other main stories are of the two policemen who killed the sniper, a citizen who helped them, another policeman who went to help at the top of the tower, a freshman with his own story of heroism, a paperboy who was shot, the radio announcer who narrated and warned of the events, and a young woman who only watched.Rita Starpattern appears only through Claire&#39;s narrative, because she died of cancer before anyone interviewed her. Some of the others had been interviewed before they died, and a few more, including Claire, were interviewed for the documentary.The last part of the film is inter cut with the interviews of the real people whose avatars have been narrating the action. By saying Claire is the anchor, I don&#39;t mean to discount the contributions of the others, most of whom performed heroically in a desperate situation.The sound of the movie is evocative, with music from the time, announcements on the radio, the cicadas of Summer, and of course the incessant gunfire.I saw the film at the Dallas International Film Festival, so the director was there to answer questions at the end. Answers I recall were that the sniper, who does not appear in the film, made a midnight call on his music teacher, saying that he was very upset and needed to talk. He sat down at the piano and played Claire de Lune, and then said that was what he needed, and left.Another was that Rita Starpattern never spoke of her actions that day. He said many people in Austin, where she had lived, gasped when they saw her name.One man in the audience said he knew the sniper&#39;s CO in the Marines, who said that the sniper was very much into his role as a killer, and looked forward to being able to kill people legally.It&#39;s odd to think of something that happened in one&#39;s own lifetime as a period piece, but younger viewers will understand more of what life was like before ubiquitous global communication. After the shooting, everyone involved lost contact with each other, something unimaginable today. A local radio announcer was the sole contact for news, and also served to warn people about what was going on. At least there were home phones, radio, TV, and 8mm cameras, so I guess it wasn&#39;t that primitive.","Nearly fifty years ago, a gunman rode the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor of the University of Texas Tower and opened fire.

And I don&#39;t understand those who say any different!! I LOVE this film!!! Every scene had something funny going on and really show the classic Aussie stereotypes!! Really good story line and fantastic actors!!I couldn&#39;t help but notice how the only bad review about this movie came from London, England and as much as they think they may understand our Aussie humour and judge it from that, they clearly don&#39;t!! The other reviews, all great and all from Aussies. I spose its one just for us!! But classic Aussie humour, lots of stupid but witty sarcasm and full of the Aussie slang!!

As we left the theater there was someone handing out brochures for an organization called &#39;World Freedom Ventures&#39;. Part of their package that you buy when you join will &quot;help you obtain a Limited Liability Corporation which will manage a bank account that holds all savings and earnings... You will also be given the opportunity to be trained and developed as a World Freedom Ventures Associate, enabling you to create your own Sovereignty business&quot;. Yes folks; it&#39;s a business. If you get fired up enough by watching this film and check out the website (and the film does a good job of prodding you to do so if you&#39;re a &#39;real&#39; patriot), you&#39;ll get the whole picture. Prosperity is the name of the game, not patriotism. Why pay your hard-earned money to a corporate government when you can be your own corporation sticking it to the little guy? That&#39;s the rub of course; working class and poor people have no &quot;assets, valuables and property&quot; to invest; somebody&#39;s gotta get screwed! &quot;As long as it&#39;s not me!&quot; is maybe &#39;The American Way&#39; to some people but I grew up in the incandescence of the JFK administration that said, &quot;ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country&quot;.I know our tax system is screwed up and our current administration is the most vile and corrupt for some 74 years. This film has some important and excellent points on the corruption of our government and the incompetence of our legal system (well, we all knew about that!). The atrocious militarism of our police force is a reality here and now, and many of the waves of the future they are foretelling are not science fiction. But... when it comes to taking in information that is as radical as we see in this film, one must consider all the sources. In this film, they&#39;ve got everyone from left-wing muckrakers like Mike Ruppert to right-wing muckrakers like Dave Champion. Many of the folks in this film are from waaaaay-out there movements or at least dumb enough to hang out with those folks. Katherine Albrecht for instance recently gave a talk for the Berean Chronicle; a group so radical that they believe that Billy Graham is Satan and that the moon landing was a fake. (Check: retakingamerica.com/past_guest for verification).I sort of recommend this film as a springboard for asking questions, not as a cause that may have you unknowingly supporting some other political agenda that you have strong disagreements with. Do your homework, and then ask the same hard questions of any organization you might join as you would your government (by all means, question them too!!!). A true patriot would do no less.","A documentary that explores the connection between income tax collection and the erosion of civil liberties in America.A documentary that explores the connection between income tax collection and the erosion of civil liberties in America.","$1,000,000.00"

I really can&#39;t understand why as it&#39;s a wonderful Film Noir-style movie with exceptionally exciting dialog and some very clever writing.Bogart plays a strange and complex character--a man who writes screenplays. At times, he&#39;s affable and decent, and at other times he&#39;s violent and cruel--getting into fights at the drop of a hat. But regardless, he was always cynical and spouted great dialog in whichever mood struck him.Towards the beginning of the film a young lady is murdered and the evidence points mainly to Bogart. Now the writers and director COULD have chosen to make it very clear to the audience what actually occurred, but there is definitely plenty of reason for the audience to suspect Bogart DID kill her and it isn&#39;t spelled out for you. Oddly, through much of the film it seemed like Bogart&#39;s character was doing everything he could to prove he might have done it! The only witness who could throw doubt on Bogart&#39;s guilt is a neighbor played wonderfully by Gloria Graham. Interestingly enough, Ms. Graham often played &quot;trashy dames&quot; in films but this time, she sported a more conservative style of hair and makeup. She was still a bit of a Noir &quot;dame&quot;, but definitely smart and with a lot of class.After providing Bogart with an alibi, the two oddly fall in love. She is firmly convinced of his innocence, though it is STILL possible that Bogart did kill the girl. And, as the film unfolds and Bogey shows an amazingly volatile temper, Graham becomes afraid of him--setting up a wonderful conclusion to the film.The best aspects of the film were the great dialog (it just sounded so gritty and cool--like a Noir flick), interesting and unique script as well as the building tension--almost like a Hitchcock film. I also liked that, for once, the film kept me guessing!","Screenwriter Dixon Steele, faced with the odious task of scripting a trashy bestseller, has hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson tell him the story in her own words.

The musicial genius of composer Raphael Fernandez-Viedma also accentuates the feeling of the story giving the audience the feeling of strangeness, of time running out, and a wonderful view of love and caring for others in our lives. During its Oscar qualifying week in Hollywood, many audience members commented on how this film moved them personally. With a very talented cast, this film is highly recommended as it tells a wonderful story of friendship and endearing love for the whole family.","Carl Hudson, an old man having lost his wife, Lisa, years before and living out the remainder of his lonely and bitter existence in the dark solitude of his cabin, frequently forgets as the days and nights incessantly blur with time. Angry, reclusive, and with no will to continue, nothing changes until one day an alien crash lands and needs his help.Carl Hudson, an old man having lost his wife, Lisa, years before and living out the remainder of his lonely and bitter existence in the dark solitude of his cabin, frequently forgets as the days and nights incessantly blur with time.

As a matter of fact, some of the problems many people have with the film virtually disappear in the novel.Annie Paradise, played by Diane Keaton, is far more annoying on screen than on page. In the film, Annie is anxious, neurotic, and just plain wimpy, in comparison to the novel Annie who happens to be quiet, and somewhat &quot;over-nice.&quot; While many find that this film is disturbingly feminist, Annie&#39;s actions are far more forgiving in the novel, which has an array of background characters which Annie&#39;s husband exploit (While in the movie, all that he does is marry her therapist). This is completely forgotten in the screenplay, where Annie&#39;s family of two sons, and a daughter with Down&#39;s Syndrome, is now whittled down to one daughter, Chris the Lesbian. One can hardly blame Annie for her actions in the novel, where Aaron Paradise, her ex-husband, favors one son and forgets the other, can never accept his handicap daughter, and steals all of her trust fund and gambles on the stock market, losing it. In the film, she just appears to be an embittered woman.Bette Midler&#39;s character of Brenda remains very similar in personality, but very different in sexuality. Her children too, get an overhaul in the novel&#39;s transition to film, but since none make much of an appearance in either, this is irrelevant. In the novel, however, Brenda&#39;s money problems are much greater, and her anger with Morty who &quot;welsched&quot; on her is so great that there&#39;s not much of a chance of her wanting to get back together with him -- besides the fact that in the novel, he&#39;s in prison, and Brenda realizes, albeit somewhat late in life, that&#39;s she&#39;s a lesbian. Instead, she gets together with her feminist lawyer who helps her take on Morty.Elise Elliot, played by Goldie Hawn, is the most shocking change of character. Elise Elliot of the film is shallow, vain, and out of work because of her impending age. Elise Elliot (Atchison) of the novel is down-to-earth, classy, intelligent, and battling to enjoy her life while still following her mother&#39;s advice of how a wealthy heiress should live. Bill, her husband, commits crimes that are minor compared to the other Wives&#39; husbands - as one of the richest women (by inheritance) in the world, she only asked that Bill would try to give her as normal of a life as possible. Instead, her cheated on her multiple times. Elise gets involved in Bill&#39;s downfall very little, however, and he brings it upon himself by falling in love with a self-destructive young woman named Phoebe. While I enjoy both the movie and the book, the comparison is depressing. The film is filled with self-righteous feminism, and is the story of three women who can&#39;t seem to handle the fact that their marriages have now ended -- and all men appear to be pigs. The novel is intelligent and funny, and the women only bring justice to their husbands, letting &quot;the punishment fit the crime.&quot; Also, in the novel, how a person acted depended on who they were, not their sex. All three Wives find love in new men (or in Brenda&#39;s case, women). While watching the First Wives Club, one must remember to take all of it&#39;s actions with a grain of salt - it is merely an exaggeration of an idea. The novel is one of justice, and an excellent account of the lives of &quot;WASPs&quot; in New York -- don&#39;t blame it for how it&#39;s been adapted.","After years of helping their hubbies climb the ladder of success, three wives have been dumped for newer, curvier models. But the trio is determined to turn their pain into gain. They come up with a cleverly devious plan to hit their exes where it really hurts, in the wallet. Sit back and watch the sparks fly as The Wives get mad, get even, and get it all. Justice has seldom been so sweet. Or so much fun.After years of helping their hubbies climb the ladder of success, three wives have been dumped for newer, curvier models. But the trio is determined to turn their pain into gain.

In the movie, Inuyasha &amp; company are drawn to a mystical island. There they have to parent a bunch of half-demon kids, while fighting four war gods. Sesshomaru and Kikyo get involved and overall its just really weird. Not necessarily confusing, but definitely weird, not to mention weak.So, in conclusion...

However , brother Dan wants more and he takes over properties . As 2 brothers go their separate ways after Civil War , one leads a peaceful life as a rancher , but the other corrupted by the war engages in a violent campaign to build his own empire ,and carrying out terrorisation . His attempt to enter business is thwarted by carpetbagger Cord Hardin : Raymond Burr . But among the growing opposition to his band is the new sheriff , to become his his nemesis , his brother Neal, along with an old friend : James Arness .It begins as a sluggish , slow-moving Western but follows to surprise us with complex characters , thrills , breathtaking patches and decent plot about two differen brothers ; as both of them end up on opposite sides of the law . The simple tale is almost rudimentary though full of clichés, as the monotonous script lines too often settle for crude routine . Suspense and tension builds over the time in which the outlaws and the starring await to take the farmer&#39;s lands . The action is decently made , as when the nasties shoot without remission and rustling cattle . The highlights of the film are the facing off between Robert Ryan and his enemies and the climatic showdown on the ending . Robert Ryan gives a nice performance as the ex-officer who forms a rustling gang and parlays his ill-gotten gains into a land empire . Rock Hudson provides a slighly laborious acting as new Marshal of Austin , but his interpretation is really eclipsed by the great Robert Ryan . His acting as the mobster-tycoon reverberates all the movie in a manner that sometimes anticapates ¨The rise and fall of Leg Diamond¨ considered to be Boetticher&#39;s the best . 
Support cast is pretty good , such as : Burr as as the nasty owner who beats and humiliates Ryan in a poker game , John McIntire as the honest father though he was only 2 years older than Ryan , James Arness , Dennis Weaver , Mae Clarke , Tom Powers , Douglas Fowley , among others.It displays an atmospheric score by Herman Stein and Henry Mancini , both of whom uncredited . Colorful cinematography in Universal style by Charles Boyle . The motion picture was professionally directed by Budd Boetticher in ordinary and traditional wake.Still apprentice work , so don&#39;t expect anything quite so stylishly spare as the Randolph Scott/Boetticher cycle , but Burt Kennedy&#39;s intelligent scripting was probably the decisive factor in those later films . Boetticher formed a production company called ¨Ranown¨ along with Harry Joe Brown and Randolph Scott and as usual writer Burt Kennedy. The first Harrry Brown-Boetticher-Scott movie was 1956&#39;s &quot; Seven men from now&quot; , following ¨Decision at sundown(57)¨, ¨Buchanan rides alone(58)¨,¨Westbound(59)¨ ,¨Ride lonesome(59) ,in the decades since, they have produced and directed one Western ¨Comanche Station(60)¨ . Boetticher was a great expert on Western genre and also on the bullfighting world as ¨Bullfighter and the lady¨, ¨The magnificent matador¨ and ¨Arruza¨ . Rating : 6/10 . Well worth watching .","Home from the Civil War, young Neal Hammond is happy to return to Texas ranching, but brother Dan wants more.

Faulkner since college, I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also named Clarence Brown as was the director, grew up in the Oxford area having been born near there in 1888. We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July, 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. It still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of Ole Miss. My recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but I was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. I was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. Anyhow, the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and I would love to know more about that story. Now days, Oxford is a larger, more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and I hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. Juano Hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year but Hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so starring Tommy Lee Jones. It really captured the intensity of rural Southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often.","Rural Mississippi in the 1940s: Lucas Beauchamp, a local black man with a reputation of not kowtowing to whites, is found standing over the body of a dead white man, holding a pistol that has recently been fired. Quickly arrested for murder and jailed, Beauchamp insists he's innocent and asks the town's most prominent lawyer, Gavin Stevens, to defend him, but Stevens refuses. When a local boy whom Beauchamp has helped in the past and who believes him to be innocent hears talk of a mob taking Beauchamp out of jail and lynching him, he pleads with Stevens to defend Beauchamp at trial and prove his innocence. —frankfob2@yahoo.comRural Mississippi in the 1940s: Lucas Beauchamp, a local black man with a reputation of not kowtowing to whites, is found standing over the body of a dead white man, holding a pistol that has recently been fired.

I like her strong will and defiance and her ironically delicate job as a violinist. I like the way she deals with her troubled past and can just announce to strangers what has happened to her. I like her stormy relationship with a jaded bachelor cop almost past his prime. All of this was told and played brilliantly. I wish that they&#39;d just left the thriller aspect out and concentrated on these two believable, real and interesting characters. That was the movie to make.

Firstly I knew it was a lower budget affair but that doesn&#39;t bother me if the film is good, I have seen my fair share of low budget horror films.
Secondly the acting wasn&#39;t to bad in the while film so that was a nice surprise.
The story itself was okay and it went at a quick pace, so you weren&#39;t bogged down by the story.
The effects for the most part were good.
I didn&#39;t think much if the ending but I knew I wouldn&#39;t watch it again, so that was okay.
One of the best parts was Stevie Lynn Jones in a wet vest but maybe that was just me.
Not a great film but not bad.

THAT film was called &quot;All About Steve.&quot; This one was in some ways a standard rom-com and yes,there were similarities to other films from &quot;Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner&quot; to &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot; But I find that all rom-coms have elements in common,so what&#39;s the big deal? The big deal is that this film involves a mixed race couple where neither one is white,in fact the girl is Mexican-American and the boy is African-American,both college educated and from families that are not poor. In fact the prospective groom&#39;s father has quite a bit of money,and the bride to be comes from a family that ,if not rich,is at least solidly middle class. I see why the critics,both professional and non,didn&#39;t &quot;get it.&quot; None of the main characters is involved in gangs,drugs, or lives in the ghetto or the barrio. There are no men dressed in drag pretending to be grandmothers either . And there are no main characters that are white. No &quot;best friend&quot; no work buddy,no obnoxious boss. The plot involves people of color having to bridge a cultural divide. Are there clichéd moments? Sure. Were the fathers sometimes over the top in their dealings with one another? You betcha! Have we seen this in other films that didn&#39;t get nearly the lashing this one did? Certainly. I enjoyed this film because ,in spite of the normal conventions of its genre,it showed people of color as normal families dealing with a situation they may not like,but having to find a way to come together for the ones they love.","""Our marriage, their wedding.""

Director Cellin Gluck delivers a grippingly emotional biopic that transcends any perceived/imaged boundaries of ethnicity in epic fashion. Glick&#39;s film (yet to be fully released--see below) re-creates the life and times of obscure Japanese diplomat, Sugihara Chiune, who turned into a world-class humanitarian all but forgotten in the fog of history (or, more likely, the smog of politically rewritten history)--until now! Sugihara Chiune became an acknowledged expert on the culture/language of the USSR with the objective of securing a diplomatic posting there just prior to WWII. It never happened. Instead he was serially posted to smaller European countries (originally to spy on the military activities of the USSR and Nazi Germany and then later to be kept politically sidelined) starting with Lithuania. The diplomat had been declared Persona Non Grata (an unwelcome foreigner) by the USSR as a result of following his superiors&#39; orders while previously posted to Manchuria. Later he was essentially declared Persona Non Grata within Japan&#39;s diplomatic corps (and the post-occupation government) as a result of not following his superiors&#39; orders. Dramatization of the latter is the core of this film. Before his Lithuania Embassy was forced to close (and later working from a hotel room), Ambassador Sugihara provided thousands of hand-written (and illegal) Japanese exit visas for displaced ethnic Jews (mostly from Poland) trapped in Lithuania. They lacked transit &quot;small pieces of paper&quot; (that no embassy was willing/able to issue) and faced imminent extermination by the Nazis (and their military collaborators). This, however, was far from a one-man humanitarian show. The refuges had help from many sympathetic to their plight (including diplomatic classmates of Sugihara Chiune posted to other countries and a newly-minted captain of a Japan-bound ship, all of whom disobeyed their superiors). In essence, a team effort! But it took the unparalleled courage of one man (with the unwavering support/encouragement of his wife) to start the ball rolling. Multicultural audience reactions to the Director&#39;s re-creation of real life-and-death historical events (the film was screened four times during CineMatsuri 2016) ranged from stark surprise to incredulity to high emotionality. Those most aware of the film&#39;s historical context are members of an ethnic group that has grown to almost 50,000 folks who literally owe their lives directly/indirectly to the self-sacrificing, humanitarian actions of Ambassador Sugihara close to 80 years ago. (Some were at the initial screening where the depth of their emotions rivaled what had been portrayed on screen!) Acting is A-list quality all round. Phonetically-spoken English and line readings dubbed/re-looped by non-native English speakers are okay (but see below). Actor Cezary Lukaszewicz in the role of the civilian German-Lithuanian personal assistant is especially outstanding. Cinematography (wide screen, color) as well as scene lighting and inter-scene lighting consistency are excellent. Set selection, design, and dressing are top of the line (during the Q&amp;A following the initial screening, Gluck noted that all scenes were shot in Poland including the interiors!). Subtitles are fine for translating Japanese into English (a few times the screen flash rate is a bit too brief). However, English spoken in the closing scenes is often hard to understand even with repeat viewings. (It could benefit from, yup, English-to-English translational subtitles!) There is one continuity glitch involving children which is amusing if you can spot it. More often than not, Japanese films tend to be too long (at least those released with English subtitles). But not this time. Here is a movie that is too short--way too short! When queried about the obvious choppy editing (during the Q&amp;A), the Director indicated he had tried unsuccessfully to obtain final-cut approval which probably would put back about 30-40 minutes (post-screening, corridor straw polls also consistently indicated that a Director&#39;s Cut version is badly needed). Opening scenes have been truncated to a point just short of becoming incomprehensible. Even with repeat viewings, it&#39;s hard to tell who is shooting at whom and why (perhaps scene-by-scene expository text could be printed at the top of the screen?). Walking the film backward in the mind&#39;s eye, it seems that opening scenes were originally meant to anchor the main plot as well as initiate multiple theme streams for PERSONA NON GRATA. The impact of a romantic subplot along the lines of CASABLANCA (Warner Bros., 1942) (with Manchuria substituting for Paris and a religious temple in Lithuania for Rick&#39;s Cafe) is all but obliterated (with remnants mostly detectable by the super discerning/ patient viewer?). Abruptly, the film ends with a short scene apparently indicating that Sugihara Chiune finally made it to Russia years later (as a relatively minor businessman?). What happened after his last posting (in Romania) and his return to his devastated homeland probably remains in the digital equivalent of the &quot;cutting room&#39;s floor.&quot; All of this may require a bit of nose holding by movie audiences in general and Japanese movie enthusiasts in particular; but, ultimately, it need not significantly diminish what Director Gluck has created: a film masterpiece! Although the movie depicts the desperation and hopelessness of displaced ethnic refugees from many, many decades ago, it obviously remains relevant today. Contemporary Japanese movie making at its finest. Not to be missed.

Known as the final cartoon from the original Warner Bros cartoon studio to be released as the division had been shut down, this 1964 short film would ultimately mark the conclusion of a highly regarded era in the eyes of classic animation fans. Looking at the short today nearly 60 years following its original release, this take on the Cinderella story with a Mexican twist has just as much going for it as it has going against it.Now arguably the biggest contributing factor of Señorella being a Mexican take on the Cinderella story lies in the art direction. As this short was directed by Hawley Pratt, known as Looney Tunes director Friz Freleng&#39;s longtime layout artist, the film looks gorgeous in its recreation of Latin American landscapes, caricatures and color palettes. One can tell how much inspiration the filmmakers took in recreating a more stylized flat looking short film as opposed to the more rubbery and geometrical slapstick cartoons in the Looney Tunes lineup, and the results are mostly well done for the type of short this is meant to be. In addition, composer Bill Lava&#39;s blending of retro Mexicano music and jazz ensemble suits the short splendidly depending on the scene, as the orchestrations flow smoothly in between many of the more saucy moments in the short. Lastly, while no particular character in the short is fleshed out at all, there are still a few humorous scenarios and pratfalls here and there to find amusement in Señorella and the Prince Don Jose Miguel, at least within the WB context.With all of those qualities said, the short is unfortunately not that common from most takes on the Cinderella story, in that its too simple and straightforward for its own good. Since the short is told through narration by two men at a Cantina, the pacing is constricted by what&#39;s being told as the film progresses, leaving very little impact on any of the characters, humor or stakes. Also, as much as the Mexican influence is all set in stone, it&#39;s painfully obvious that no matter how much tribute is being paid towards one country, the short reeks of white people trying to replicate a certain style and falling short in stereotypical character designs, eye rolling Latina puns and an outdated twist ending related to the story that was no longer funny by the time of the short&#39;s release. Considering that we as Americans have come to better terms with respecting other countries through film and animation, this short is at least more tastefully done than other cartoons prior to its time but not close enough. It says a whole lot when the title is somewhat of an indicator on what you&#39;ll expect for both better and worse.So as a final wrap up for the original Warner Bros cartoon filmography, Señorella and the Glass Huarache is a decent enough conclusion to a beloved era with as many strong points as it has flaws. For all of its Latin American influence going for its artistically, it still falls short due to its already routine storyline basis and impulsive need to romanticize the aesthetic it&#39;s going for. I would recommend this short on the grounds of judging it by its own merits as opposed to the final short from a studio cherished by animation fans, since it should be taken under admiration but with a grain of salt.","In a Mexican restaurant, a man named Jose tells to his friend, Manuel, the story of Senorella, a Mexican version of Cinderella.

I stumbled across this light-hearted comedy amongst the darker, more-serious norm at the San Francisco Black Film Festival in early June. I decided to give it a shot, having been emotionally consumed by all the social commentary of the rest of the lot. I was picked up indeed. Watching David and Andrew unsuspectingly gallivant around with the mob&#39;s money is pure and hilarious entertainment. The characters are genuine, and the jokes inventive, while the incorporation of jazz into the soundtrack is anything but cliché. The opening shot is nostalgic San Francisco, my hometown, and the montage near the middle of the film made me laugh harder than I have in a long while. I walked out of the Eureka Theatre with a sore abdomen and a smile stretching from ear to ear. Don&#39;t miss this one if given the opportunity.","David Arnold and Andrew Sloan are two high school nerdy-outcasts, your typical losers. They've got no game and more importantly, no dates for prom.

I mean seriously, ants?Phase IV managed to change my mind on that and made ants a legitimately terrifying credible enemy.It tells the story of a pair of scientists who set up a lab in the middle of the desert where ants seem to have taken over. Right beside a failed desert development they underestimate the intelligence of their diminutive foes.The first thing that struck me was how good it all looked, the movie is years ahead of its time in both cinematography and practical effects. The ant sequences are truly remarkable and not rushed as you tend to expect them to be for the mid 70&#39;s. They take their time, intricately crafting the ants world, telling their silent story and solidifying their credibility as threats to mankind.I went in expecting some hammy mess, what I got was an elusive diamond in the rough and I&#39;m very very impressed.Well acted, visually stunning and paced perfectly Phase IV is a great sci-fi piece that didn&#39;t deserve to go under the radar the way it did.Fantastic stuff.The Good:Well ahead of its timeLooks greatAnt footage is very impressiveStrong castThe Bad:The nagging concern of possible animal crueltySilly ant noises","Desert ants suddenly form a collective intelligence and begin to wage war on the inhabitants.

Frank Sinatra plays the title role--a private detective who seems very cool and disaffected. Of the three detective shows he made in the late 60s, I&#39;d rate this one #2--behind the superior film &quot;The Detective&quot;. However, this exceptional film is not related to &quot;Tony Rome&quot; or its sequel &quot;The Lady in Cement&quot;. Regardless, Sinatra&#39;s world-weary performances were excellent--even if he seemed to try to make it look like he&#39;s not trying.The film begins with Tony doing what seems like a very mundane and not at all dangerous task--bringing home a drunk young lady to her rich daddy (Simon Oakland). Oddly, however, this good deed ended up leading to an apparently minor task--to find the young lady&#39;s missing earring. And, this task led to murder...in fact, a LOT of murders and mayhem. By late 60s standards, this film is awfully violent and Tony isn&#39;t exactly always the macho hero. Although he generally gets the best of it, he, too, gets the crap knocked out of him a few times in this rough and tumble film.As I said, I preferred Sinatra&#39;s &quot;The Detective&quot;, but not by much. &quot;Tony Rome&quot; is a very good private eye film--a bit like a grittier version of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;...minus most of the laughs. It&#39;s also odd that Tony is NOT the perfect manly sort of hero--especially since he repeatedly shows a stronger desire to wrap up the case than unwrap the very alluring Jill St. John--who spends much of the movie pursuing Tony. A very good film--especially since the mystery turns out to be a very interesting one. Worth your time.By the way, a couple interesting parts in the film are a cameo by the ex-champ Rocky Graziano as well as a VERY unusual sort of role for the comic Shecky Greene. Also, I just loved Tony&#39;s line &quot;This is not a family. Just a bunch of people living at the same address.&quot; Priceless and indicative of the sort of smart-allecky stuff he tosses about during the film.","Ex-cop turned private eye, Tony Rome lives and works in Miami.

Justine is a mythological creation. She is the white goddess, Diana bathing, la Belle Dame Sans Merci, Cassandra tormented by futurity. It ends in Gottedammerung, the destruction of the world. The Cannes jury was right to honour it. In 2, 10 or 100 years this will be manifestly THE film of 2011, capturing as it does this precise historical moment, on the cusp of epochs. More than just an economic crisis, or even the end of Western capitalism, or the American Century, or of Europe - though it is all that - it is the consummation in fire of all we have ever known. Leaders and experts sit mesmerised and powerless, making reassuring noises, or setting aside puny provisions; taking shelter in denial or custom. While Melancholia and Earth act out their dance of death; gravity, the most ineluctable force in the universe, does its work. Justine, being incapable of happiness, is therefore incapable of illusion. She has always known. Herself untouched by affect, by human assimilation or persuasion, she writes the killer tag lines which manipulate others. Having a damaged soul, she suffers from a disorder of perception - she sees things as they actually are. She knows precisely how many beans are in the jar -like those who called the top of the Dow Jones index, at 12807 exactly. On one level, she represents the spirit of financialisation, the final, hottest white dwarf phase of capitalism, quantifying, inhumane, ultra-competitive (seen also in Skaarsgard&#39;s brutal ad boss, and in the brother-in-law who paid for the wedding - &quot;an arm and a leg, for most people&quot; -he means it literally I think - chilling!) And, like the Sybil, Justine wants to die. She wills the destruction of herself and everything else. &#39;The Earth is evil.&#39;LVT is the holy idiot of European cinema. Much as Justine destroys her stellar career, then hours later, in the garden, consciously and irrevocably obliterates her marriage and future happiness, so LVT - in the most perfect example of parallel process - in his acceptance speech at Cannes compulsively befouls himself, his credibility, future opportunities, his film and all associated with it. (Poor Dunst, beside him. Did she always know? I wonder.) Which brings me to Kirsten Dunst.Once the all-American teenage sweetie in some of my favourite films.(The US invented the teenager, much as the English Victorians invented childhood, and its richest and most creative seam of film and TV deal with this stage of life. In a way, America is the world&#39;s teenager; and all teenagers are Americans by proxy.) In fact, Dunst is German-American, with all the ancestral baggage that implies. (Read Sylvia Plath&#39;s &#39;Daddy&#39; if you don&#39;t know what I mean). Beneath the apple-pie sunny exterior of her teen roles, there was always something remote and uncanny about her beauty. And now, with teen / young adult roles behind her, this strangeness, this well, German-ness, is exposed. In the riveting opening shots of &#39;Melancholia&#39; she looks like Marlene Dietrich - unheimlich, fascinating. Like la Belle Dame Sans Merci, she takes possession of a man through his unconscious: like the groom in the film, he will follow her, exchanging all that is dear - home, family and hope of happiness - for bitterness and despair. In the scene in the limo, the earliest, lightest part of the story, she seems American, in accent, face, body, She becomes less American , more northern European, and ultimately less like a human being at all, as her story unwinds. Those who criticise the inconsistency in her accent are missing the point. The change is about the character, not her nationality, which is purposely vague. (In fact, in what country does the film take place? Would you ask that question of &#39;the Ring&#39;?) I get the impression that just as Lars is working through some issues around his German-ness – hence the Wagnerianism -, so is Dunst, which must have made his Cannes performance doubly excruciating. (I hear she wants to be called &#39;Keersten&#39; now, pronounced the German way.) For the girl who has been being other people superbly well from her childhood, it seems to me that Dunst the adult truly exposes something painfully real of herself in this film. (&#39;Exposing&#39; is the right word in every way.) And she pulls it off. The film is stunning. She is stunning, and thoroughly deserves Best Actress. Bravo, Lars von Trier!","On the night of her wedding, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) is struggling to be happy even though it should be the happiest day of her life. It was an extravagant wedding paid for by her sister and brother-in-law who are trying to keep the bride and all the guests in line. Meanwhile, Melancholia, a blue planet, is hurtling towards the Earth.

It is based on a Knut Hamsun novel. It stars Rutger Hauer as an enigmatic agronomist who finds himself in a small town near the ocean. It has a truly European flavor. He is long on ambition and very lonely. He becomes a puzzle to the people in the town, despised by some. He befriends a midget, whom the locals actually call &quot;Midget.&quot; He falls in love with a vain woman who rejects him and manipulates. He falls back on an older woman who lives in a hovel on the side of a hill. He seems desperate, but he is so darned weird and so full of mysteries that no one can really figure him out. He is obviously despairing of a previous life and can&#39;t seem to move ahead. He is very strong and self centered in some respects; yet, he is fragile and self destructive in others. The midget is his true friend and we find out that he has great sympathy for his plight (he is ill treated daily by the villagers), yet we find him, at times, almost as cruel as the townspeople. He becomes angry at the midget because he doesn&#39;t stand up for himself, yet he is totally closed up himself. The strength and the weakness of the film is our lack of concrete connection to the man. He is likable at times and so irrational at others. It&#39;s a film well worth watching. It was filmed on the Isle of Mann which adds to its mysterious nature.","A wealthy visitor to a small town befriends a midget and gets involved with two women as his behaviour becoming ever stranger.A wealthy visitor to a small town befriends a midget and gets involved with two women as his behaviour becoming ever stranger.",""

I&#39;ve seen many awful movies and while this is one of them, it&#39;s certainly not the worst.Howe&#39;s photography is quite good considering the low budget and time constraints. The real footage he shot on a carrier and in actual helicopter training are excellent stock footage although they don&#39;t fit into the rest of the film very well. Most of the shots are in focus with just one shot certainly out of focus and a few combat scenes that are strangely blurry. The locations (mostly run down industrial parks) are creepy and the hand-held camera motion is often very good. Some of the sets are not as bad as I expected and almost reach mid-90&#39;s cable television quality. And of course the explosions are so good you&#39;ll get to see them over and over. Producer/Director/Actor John Christian has a nice restrained acting style which I&#39;m sure he refined over his many low budget productions. Several other actors put in adequate performances. I expected the editing and pacing to bother me more than they did.What really kills the film is it&#39;s obvious that no frame of it was ever intended to be shown in a theater. It&#39;s shot full frame, the title cards were obviously added in video, and there are even long fade to blacks that might as well say &quot;Airboss will be right back after these messages!&quot; You never forget that you&#39;re watching the lowest-budget television imaginable. There are far too many closeups of actors pointing at stuff and describing it to us, strategically avoiding any background that could tell us where they are. Many scenes appear to be first takes with lots of panning substituting for coverage. The combat scenes have no direction with tanks moving around aimlessly and guns shooting in every direction.Some of the acting and dialog is terrible. Kayle Watson is good looking but rarely delivers a line convincingly. His acting couldn&#39;t buy a role in a Lifetime movie. Caroline Strong has had some success in television but tries too hard with her &quot;tough woman&quot; act which is not helped with the terrible &quot;tough woman&quot; dialog she was given. The moments of painfully bad dialog are numbed by needlessly long scenes of dull exposition but the painful scenes still linger in your mind.The plot is nothing more than a series of barely-related international crises designed to send our heroes to what appears to be the same location over and over to shoot bad guys, kidnap terrorists, and bring some American justice to the rest of the world. It repeats over and over until the movie is long enough to finally end. This formula is not much different from a season of &quot;24&quot;.I will not be watching any of the sequels.","Hidden at a desolate air base in a former Soviet Republic is an awesome weapon, the only working prototype of the MIG 35 ""Firebomb"" the Soviet stealth fighter/bomber.

The sequel was rushed into production to capitalise on the success of the first, so obviously there is a drop in quality.  Brigitte Lin did not &quot;retire&quot; as such, but got married, which in Hong Kong cinema often counts as the same thing - its seen as bad form if a woman has to work because it suggests that the husband is not providing. The rest of us know that acting in movies doesn&#39;t actually count as real work, but we almost lost Maggie Cheung to this odd syndrome, and even Michelle Yeoh retired for the few years when she was married to a big name producer. Anyway, Brigitte Lin is still fine in this film (great to see a woman &quot;of a certain age&quot; still given such a strong part in a HK film), despite her performance being simplistically villainous throughout.  And Christy Chung is fantastic in a cigarette chewing pastiche of Chow Yun Fat.  The gender politics in this movie are particularly striking - the men are mostly sexist pigs trembling in the face of female empowerment, while the women inhabit a man-hating commune where they are gradually eradicating the two-timing dogs from their world (&quot;Men. I see one, I kill one.&quot;).  Both are somewhat reprehensible in their own way, but in the Asian context, it is notable that many such films indulge fantasies of powerful evil women permitting spectacular displays of forceful sexuality which is always punished or destroyed at the end to return the gender balance to its patriarchal, safe norm.  As such, it fits neatly into all the categories which have made Hong Kong films so fascinating and extreme to Western viewers.","For ten years, Cho has been in the snow of Mount Shin Fung waiting for a rare flower to blossom that will cure his wife who, back in Chung Yuan, is slowly killing all of the members of the Eight Big Clans.

It is a remarkable achievement, largely attributable the dogged hard work and shoestring organization by Maureen and her capable sidekick Sonam Rigzen Attending to monks' health problems while in Australia, over several years, Maureen discovered that a large number of them were suffering from stomach pain and were , after years of going to GPs, finally diagnosed with the stomach bug, Helicobacter Pylori. The discovery and cure for Helicobacter Pylori won Perth Drs Robin Warren and Barry Marshall a Nobel Prize for medicine in 2005. After identifying the new bug, they discovered that a simple course of antibiotics could prevent ulcers and preempt stomach cancer, save lives and relieve years of suffering. —Mark Gould","A$40,000.00"

"2024-01-29","Message of Hope","","[""Drama""]","Six children--three girls, three boys--living in a well-off community grow up with the benefits and luxuries that come with their birthright. They attend a Christian school where faithful Pastor Anne teaches them Biblical studies. But except for one girl, Sarah's, compassionate efforts, many of the poor in the surrounding suburbs are left forgotten and ignored by the materialistic and wealthy yet uncaring adults, especially Sarah's father James, who is hardened by the world around him. Although the children attend a Christian school, Sarah's views are widely uncommon among her friends, except for John, who pays close attention to her every move. The two form a spiritual bond, one they hope to maintain forever as someday Heaven awaits. When they are 18-year-old high-school seniors, Sarah feels rejected by the world around her, with the exception of John and Mr. Henshaw, a homeless man she befriends. But after Mr. Henshaw's untimely passing, tragedy suddenly hits when another of the boys, Michael, shatters the world around them by committing suicide. Sarah cries out for love and attention, but one senseless act drives her to the brink of destruction. As she recovers, she spends summer away from her friends. The neighboring community of friends and adults gather and desperately try to make sense of what drove Michael to suicide and Sarah to near destruction. Sarah's close friends begin to realize that money and material things are not so important, but the love and compassion that Sarah shows is what they truly desire and is strong enough to change the world for the better. When John receives a visit from an ""Angel of GOD"" he writes a story of hope and compassion, ""A Message of Hope,"" to honor his dear friends, Michael and Sarah. As the children's parents begin to wonder what is right and what is wrong, a sense of fortunate birthright might not be what they all thought it once was. But the children quickly realize that there are no victims; we all have the power of choice: to choose Life and Love. The school year comes to a close and the summer eventually draws to an end, but not before the return of an old friend. Love is rekindled between John and Sarah, a love that unites them on Earth as young adults as they wait for the glory of Heaven.","[{""names"":[],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[],""title"":""Writer""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777290"",""name"":""Mickele Hogan""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6165772"",""name"":""Sean Tivenan""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777291"",""name"":""Midi Miller""}],""title"":""Stars""}]","[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/video/vi288535577"",""name"":""Message Of Hope""}]","[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044488/mediaviewer/rm2848664320"",""name"":""Message of Hope (2014)""}]","[{""actor"":""Mickele Hogan"",""character"":""Sarah Matriciano"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777290""},{""actor"":""Sean Tivenan"",""character"":""John Romanelli"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6165772""},{""actor"":""Midi Miller"",""character"":""Barbara Matriciano"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777291""},{""actor"":""Megan Lee Miller"",""character"":""Bonnie Tellgman"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6943487""},{""actor"":""Matthew Louie"",""character"":""Michael Hines"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5842865""},{""actor"":""Gabrielle Esposito"",""character"":""Bridget Young"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777293""},{""actor"":""Nic Marcotrigiano"",""character"":""Billy Jacobs"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6874636""},{""actor"":""Anouk Dutruit"",""character"":""Pastor Anne"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2088923""},{""actor"":""Mackenzie Weatherby"",""character"":""Young Sarah"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777295""},{""actor"":""Sam Pelaez"",""character"":""Young John"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777296""},{""actor"":""Mary Hudak"",""character"":""Young Bridgette"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777297""},{""actor"":""Fisher Hudak"",""character"":""Young Billy"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777298""},{""actor"":""Mekelsey Montgomery"",""character"":""Young Bonnie"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777299""},{""actor"":""Jared Brito"",""character"":""Young Michael"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777300""},{""actor"":""Matt Nicholas"",""character"":""James Matriciano"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4702430""},{""actor"":""Doug Heir"",""character"":""Bob Hines"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777301""},{""actor"":""Deborah Sarnel"",""character"":""Tricia Romanelli"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6777302""},{""actor"":""Denyse Ellington"",""character"":""Pam Young"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4102874""}]","12/27/2014 (United States)","United States","","English","","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Bluesky Magic Productions","","","","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044488/","Feature Film",5.00,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044488/mediaviewer/rm2848664320",34.00,"",1.00,"",2.00,1.00,"I understand that most Christian movies do not have a large budget so that production value might be less than large budget films.

It&#39;s the type of movie where what&#39;s on screen is enough to let a person get a gist of the scene. When I first saw the movie, I remembered how lovely the music was, how I grew to love the &quot;crazy&quot; people from the asylum, and how beautiful the movie was. When my mom bought the movie, we watched it constantly. I still watch it at least once a month. It&#39;s one of my favorite movies. I really do love the music. For me, it simulates fun insanity.

It is partly based on a true event that occurred in 1950, where the Kinkaku-ji temple in Kyoto was burned down by a 22-year-old novice monk (see wikipedia for details). What to say about this movie... Some good some bad. The acting is decent, if a bit excessively theatrical at times. The photography is very classical with beautiful compositions and interesting angles. The story explores two important society issues: forced prostitution and bullying. Unfortunately some inadequacies prevents it from reaching the heights of a masterpiece. One of the glaring issues my wife and I had was this odd picturing of a brothel as a pleasant place where all is well among all the girls and the well meaning Madame. It seems so far fetched, so unlikely, that I kept wondering if this director had ever visited such an establishment. Also, some of the comments regarding the girl made by her first customer seemed very strange and even abnormal to us. I can&#39;t reveal them here, but they surprised us greatly. On the other hand the purity of the love story and the drama brought about by the iniquity of society was quite touching. So, yes, I would say it&#39;s worth watching, just not as good as I was hoping for.","A movie set in Kyoto, Japan in 1950. It's about a beautiful young girl (who was sold by her father to a brothel) and a stammering trainee monk (who was sent to a famous temple in Kyoto by his mother). The two main characters love each other and dream of returning to their home-town and marrying. But things don't work out so peachy and after the trainee monk gets into trouble with the police he flips and sets fire to the temples' beautiful golden pavilion. He dies in the inferno and the girl, who had been in hospital, flees to the beach near where she used to live and she passes away. Her father and the boys' mother are there with her at the end. —F.

The soundtrack is of both beautiful and haunting quality, the dialogue has some funny, dark and poignant moments throughout and the story is heartfelt and charming with a dark centre to it too. As well as looking cute, the characters are likable and aren&#39;t thankfully devoid of personality. The voice acting is great, especially from Orson Welles.Overall, The Enchanted Journey is lovely and worth looking out for. 10/10 Bethany Cox","Glicko, a young chipmunk living in the city with his sister, is enticed by the words of Pippo, the carrier pigeon, to leave home and find the Great Forest, the true home of chipmunks.

Farnum had entered features in 1914 and was a well-regarded talent. Although his star had dimmed considerably with advancing age and the coming of sound to pictures, he continued to work regularly, half in important roles in B westerns, like his brother Dustin Farnum, and half in smaller and cameo roles in programmers. It&#39;s a good story, with some decent twists and should please fans of the genre.","Ranger Ray plans to marry stage driver Bill Mason's daughter Mary.

Chenn mines the idea for some wonderful; interviews with a wild range of characters, an android, shapeshifter, alien twins, a vampire, Chinese God, werewolf, Icelandic troll, a Unicorn, a time traveler and a sea nymph. The interviewers Collins Jahn (Brad Roller) and Merle Eppis (Laura Waddell) are spot on as straight man and comedic sidekick. Waddell is particularly enjoyable playing off the slightly exasperated exterior Roller holds so well. The character coming in for interviews make the film with highlights and in particular, the recently separated alien twins Collees (Rachel Rath) and Risa Ipsett (Sherill Turner) who banter and complete each other sentences while still drawing the difference that made them want to explore being separate beings. The over the top time traveler, Taryn Kamus (Napolean Ryan) in his pink shorts and bow tie was hilarious in his bombastic expressions of the coming end to the world we know. The unicorn in human form Eatha Haemm was so spot on it was scary. Actress Maria Olsen pulled off a physical performance that left you not needed to see her transform into a unicorn to believe it.The beautiful Paulie Rojas plays the sea nymph Nairie Sleen who is destined to fall for our guy Collins Jahn. She channels Audrey Hepburn through a series of clips of her trying to find the offices. When they finally meet it is inevitable that they fall in love. This was an enjoyable film really a perfect entry into the festival. We all can look forward to this talented writer/director Justin Calen Chenn in the future. The actors were all very good and I am sure we will see many of them also.","Over the course of one day, an android, a water nymph, a time traveler, a couple aliens, an angel, a vampire, and many other mythic beings of folklore are interviewed and asked to update a fictional government agency on their lives.

But the sad truth is that the film fully deserves its current obscurity status. The story of an ambitious cameraman not being able to find decent assignments in Hollywood, and his job of shooting sleazy adult movies driving him to strangle random women, certainly holds potential, but it&#39;s dull and amateurish beyond comparison. Some sequences, like the family-photos montage during the opening credits, indicate that director Christina Hornisher really had a tragic story to share, but she lacks the financial means - and the talent - to make it happen. The film is ugly to look at, poorly acted and edited even worse, and it&#39;s full of padding footage of the lead actor pointlessly driving around in LA&#39;s sleaziest red-light districts.","Mark, a young photographer, travels to Hollywood hoping to make it as a cameraman in the movie business.

P. Lockney. Hal is willing to forgive ex-convict William Bertram, and thinks that Bertram&#39;s daughter, Jean Arthur, is good enough to work, despite her disgraceful antecedents. When Talliaferro is locked up overnight because of a misunderstanding, his father kicks him off the ranch. After a few weeks, almost starving, his horse repossessed by the livery stable, he&#39;s walking to a distant ranch looking for work, when he runs across Art Winkler. Winkler tries to rob him, but he has nothing, so they agree to be partners, and because Talliaferro wins a deck cut, they decide to find work rather than people to rob.It&#39;s a pleasant enough B western directed by Richard Thorpe near the beginning of his career. That was the way into the system for directors as well as actors in the late silent era. You could do short comedies, and work your way up, or B westerns, and likewise. For actors, it seemed to depend on whether you had a horse or not. And just as it seems that every screen comic, no matter how bad, got a shot at leading a series of short comedies, every cowboy actor seemed to get a shot at being a leading man.And so did Talliaferro. It didn&#39;t last much past sound coming in, and by 1937, he ceased to be credited -- when he was credited -- as Wales. His more than 200 screen credits include about 5 non-westerns, almost invariably for Poverty Row productions. His last credit was in 1952, when the B western was dying. He passed on in 1980 at the age of 84.","Upon his release from prison, Jim Regan, who had been framed for theft by Dan Norris, is jailed again for attempting to shoot Norris.

Carney&#39;s an over-the-hill keyhole peeper, while new-age Tomlin can&#39;t settle on any identity. All in all, it&#39;s a great send-up of all those tough-guy private dicks of the 1940&#39;s. But don&#39;t try to follow the murder plot, which has more little twists than a mountain road. Actually, more than a whodunit, the story&#39;s about two lonely people managing to overcome personality and generational differences. There&#39;s that, plus hints that old Ira&#39;s (Carney) ulcers may have failed, but the glands are still working. As the odd couple, Carney and Tomlin shine in low-key fashion, which is as engaging as it is offbeat. There were a lot of these Chandler-Hammett spoofs at the time, (e.g. The Black Bird {1975}), but none are more imaginative than this-- after all, how many tough guys ride buses to work, or are hired to find a missing cat. Then too how many other send-ups can stand on their own apart from the spoofing format. Cleverly, this one can—as a poignant character study that somehow works. Kudoes Robert Benton for coming up with a truly novel approach to familiar subject matter. The result is both amusing and touching.","Ira Wells is an aged retired Los Angeles, California based private investigator who comes out of retirement when his former partner, Harry Regan, shows up on his doorstep with a bullet wound to the gut and dies. Ira determines to find out who killed Harry and is then contacted by another long-time acquaintance, Charlie Hatter (a down-on-his luck Hollywood hack/bartender) about Harry's last case. Harry's client was Margo Sterling, a former client of Charlie's who is a flaky, penniless new-age actress, agent, and dress maker. She hired Harry to retrieve her missing cat, Winston, who is being held ransom by an acquaintance named Brian Hemphill who stole Winston because Margo was late on paying back a loan.

"2024-01-29","Approaching the Speed of Sound","","[""Documentary"",""Short""]","This is the first in a series of three educational films entitled ""High Speed Flight"". This film produced in 1956 looks at the aerodynamics of flight at speeds approaching the speed of sound, using animated sequences to illustrate important physical principles.

Sound travels through the air in a series of waves of compression and expansion. Sound waves spread out from their source in all directions and at the same speed, the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies according to the temperature of the air in which it travels. The higher the temperature, the faster sound travels. Since the temperature falls with increasing altitude, so the speed of sound falls with increasing altitude.

At high speeds, the exact relationship between the speed of an aircraft and the speed of sound is very important. The ratio of the aircraft's true air speed to the speed of sound is called the aircraft's Mach Number (M). At high speeds it is essential for the pilot to know the Mach Number, so Mach meters are fitted to all high speed aircraft.

The behaviour of the air flow around the aircraft during flight is extremely complex. During flight, the air flow slows down at the nose to form what is called the stagnation region. The air then speeds up as it passes round the curvature of the wing and slows down again towards the trailing edge of the wing section. These changes in speed cause changes in air pressure. All the variations in pressure together produce lift and drag.

At speeds approaching the speed of sound, the air flow speeds up as it passes over the wing and reaches a maximum speed at a certain point on the wing. The Mach Number here will always be greater than that of the aircraft as a whole, called the flight Mach Number. An aircraft may be flying at less than the speed of sound, but the speed of the air flow at the point on the wing may be moving at the speed of sound. The flight Mach Number when this happens is called the Critical Mach Number of the aircraft.

When the wing exceeds its Critical Mach Number, a sudden sharp region of increasing density forms on the wing. This is called a shock wave. It is a very narrow region where the pressure waves caused by the moving aircraft meet the air flow moving in the opposite direction, causing a pile up of air. At speeds approaching the speed of sound, the most important result of the shock wave is to cause the air flow to spread from the wing's surface. This is called shock induced separation. It produces a large turbulent wake that alters the pressure distribution. Violent buffeting may occur or there may be a sudden loss of stability and reduced effectiveness of the controls.

Two main wing designs have been adopted to reduce the problems of extra drag and loss of control caused by shock waves. The first is to use relatively thin wings. The thinner the wing, the less the air accelerates, which delays the onset of the shock wave. The second is to incorporate sweep back in the wing design. A special kind of sweep back is the crescent wing. Another, the delta wing, combines a high degree of sweep back with great strength. Sweep back and thin wings bring problems at low speeds, so designers must compromise between high speed and low speed requirements.","[{""names"":[],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[],""title"":""Writer""}]","","[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7354818/mediaviewer/rm2448171521"",""name"":""Approaching the Speed of Sound (1957)""}]","","11/30/1956 (United Kingdom)","United Kingdom","","English","Approaching the.......

We are told that the cool air in the stratosphere makes the speed of sound different from sea level. That&#39;s true enough, but it ignores the issue of air pressure. The movie then goes on to discuss how a wing looks in the air, the air flow around it, and issues like the shock wave. It makes frequent statements, like &quot;the wing cannot be made too thin because it couldn&#39;t land.&quot; Why is that? We are never told.","This is the first in a series of three educational films entitled ""High Speed Flight"". This film produced in 1956 looks at the aerodynamics of flight at speeds approaching the speed of sound, using animated sequences to illustrate important physical principles.Sound travels through the air in a series of waves of compression and expansion. Sound waves spread out from their source in all directions and at the same speed, the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies according to the temperature of the air in which it travels. The higher the temperature, the faster sound travels.

It was on a Double Bill along with another American-International Pictures&#39; Classic, HELL SQUAD (also 1958).**During that period, we were gobbling up any thing involving The Armed Forces, World War II and Korea.We all built model airplanes, model tanks &amp; half-tracks, any thing Army. We also put together numbers like the U.S.S. Missouri and the Nautilas (the Navy&#39;s, not Walt Disney&#39;s!).We would frequently stop in to our local Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force and Marine Recruiting offices and mooch any hand out recruiting literature that they had. They always obliged and were very friendly and courteous.On Television during that period, we had several programs on the Networks and in Syndication that had military themes. We can recall: The Silent Service, Citizen Soldier, Steve Canyon, Navy Log and even Phil Silvers as SGT. BILKO. Others followed in the years to come.What all the preceding reminiscing was about was to set up the following evaluation of TANK BATALLION.We knew that TANK BATTALION was a cheapie. It was an Independent Production, released by American-International. It was intended, you can be sure, to be part of those multi picture programs not watched at the local &quot;Passion Pits&quot;,aka Drive-In Movies.It did, however, provide an afternoon&#39;s fun for the kids in the neighborhood. And, though probably completely overlooked is that a movie, any movie can have a good effect on young minds, as long as it isn&#39;t too &quot;adult&quot;. What gives it value is a certain relation to Real Historical Events. Even if it is only a passing reference or the mentioning of some actual Battle, it has a certain value.But what we remembered most was one of the Actors featured as a member of the Tank&#39;s Crew. (sure was a small Battalion!) He had the nickname of &quot;Skids&quot;, and he was always amusing the crew with Movie Star Impersonations. We really liked his James Cagney! It was all &#39;Thumbs Up&quot; from us that day.Well, this was the first time for our seeing this &quot;Skids&quot; guy, but he surely had a real talent and was so gifted as to rise far above this schlock film. His name was Frank Gorshin.We were privileged a number of years later to meet Mr. Gorshin. The first time was at a special Batman TV Show Convention, commemorating the Series&#39; 30th Anniversary.(it was in Summer of 1995, a little early but...).The Second time, we saw him at a Bud Courts&#39; Hollywood Collectibles Show also here in Chicago. It was at this time we got to talk much more with him. We found him to be warm, friendly and very courteous and personable to his many fans. He had just finished a one man show engagement as George Burns, a production that we regrettably did not see. But it got really good reviews.It was probably one of his last public performances, this George Burns thing. Sadly, he passed away not too long afterwords, and not that long ago. We will long remember him as a &#39;regular&#39; guy as much for his filmed and record work. The sight of him on that Saturday, dressed ever so casually, wearing his Pittsburgh Pirates cap. He confessed to still being that Pittsburgh kid,his moods rising and falling with the fortune of the &#39;Bucs&#39;.* No, not those Younger Brothers, contemporaries of Jesse James! I meant my younger brothers.** It wasn&#39;t long that pictures like this would be shown on television. Now, I swear! My right hand to God! HELL SQUAD was on one of our local TV Stations within 6 months of our seeing it at the show! Honest Injun! Cross My Heart and hope to die! It&#39;s the truth.","Four men in their tank, during the Korean War in 1951, find themselves behind enemy lines.Four men in their tank, during the Korean War in 1951, find themselves behind enemy lines.",""

I always see movies cold, with little or no knowledge of the sometimes pretentious &quot;concept&quot; behind the film, but for this film Cocteau is a great reference. The cinematography is a worthy tribute to Kubrick&#39;s early style. It is clear that there is sophisticated and complex metaphor embedded throughout the film, though it&#39;s not as pretentiously baffling as say, Tarkovsky&#39;s &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. I have to grudgingly recommend that one should see the website for an overview of cremaster 2 to fully appreciate the sequence, if not the brilliant execution, because in cremaster 2, writer/director Matthew Barney shows a gift for making stunning, almost schizophrenic connections among wildly disconnected stories which are each revolutionary even when taken alone. If you can stay with the film, the dawning of their connections is devastating.I apparently saw Cremaster 1 and then 2 shown together which was actually even better, especially without the benefit of knowing they were separate films. Cremaster 1, which is like Kubrick&#39;s best work- beautifully minimalistic, quietly disturbing, seductive and surreal. It&#39;s also completely disconnected from the essential sequence of cremaster 2 so it serves to provoke imagination and destroy conceptual barriers before cremaster 2 starts. The sequence starts with the pristine, amorphous canvas of cremaster1, then becomes gradually more coherent in some unknown direction, and finally crystallizes into an almost tangible object. There is not a normal conclusion or an ending. The separate stories form an object. A beautiful, complete and complex object.The film is truly working at all levels, and I believe it manages to break new ground conceptually. I consider it a genuine modern surrealist masterpiece, somewhat in the vein of Kubrick.","A Gothic Western loosely based on Gary Gilmore's life, executed for murder in Utah.

So my question is how is this lame piece of crapola ranking a 6.3 while &quot;Death Game&quot; (which rules) is getting a 5.2? It&#39;s not right. Anyways, this movie isn&#39;t totally awful and I tend to grade on a curve for independent, cheapo releases like this. Clearly some effort went into the film and, in fact, there is an OK story buried in the BS, but it is diluted by several scenes that just didn&#39;t need to be in the movie which pretty much ruins what little it had going for it. If it had been whittled down to fit into the traditional 90 minutes and focused on the story instead of forcing us to watch lame alternative bands or the lead character (who could pass for Ian Curtis from Joy Division&#39;s cousin) scoring with chicks way above his pay grade, it would be a decent enough movie, although the plot gets a little hard to swallow towards the end. Almost two hours is too much and I actually had to fast forward, which is something I rarely do. Two stars for this.","When Christopher, a young audio fanatic accidentally records a brutal murder, his pursuit of the killer lures him into a sinister plot of revenge and deceit.When Christopher, a young audio fanatic accidentally records a brutal murder, his pursuit of the killer lures him into a sinister plot of revenge and deceit.",""

If you&#39;ll remember he was abandoned on deserted asteroid. The Fury deals with a young man on the way to being another Gary Lockwood.Young Andrew Stevens has those abilities already, they just need to be focused and developed. Stevens is being raised by his widowed father Kirk Douglas who&#39;s a government agent. A raid while they&#39;re on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by John Cassavetes to separate father from son. Stevens believes Dad has died, but Kirk doesn&#39;t swallow that so easy.Kirk&#39;s on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like Stevens with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon. Carrie Snodgrass and Charles Durning are working there as well. And so is Fiona Lewis who&#39;s been given personal charge of Stevens and develops the kid&#39;s libido as well as his telekinesis.Brian DePalma directed this film and it&#39;s a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast. Look for a good performance from Amy Irving as another young person with such abilities who literally makes Cassavetes fall apart at the end. And there&#39;s a memorable bit from a younger and thinner Dennis Franz before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective Andrew Sipowicz. Franz plays a Chicago police officer who&#39;s something of a doofus. Fans of Brian DePalma in particular and horror films in general will very much like The Fury.","A secret US agency behind the unscrupulous Childress gathers children with parapsychologic abilities and trains them to become killers in war situations.

He talks about Ian Flemming using this gun and we also get three demons of other guns and the damage they could have been done. This here is certainly for Bond die-hards only. There&#39;s nothing too wrong here but it was a decent little short as it&#39;s clear Boothroyd knows what he&#39;s talking about and he gives good opinions on why certain weapons just wouldn&#39;t work.

So far, my favorite from that period, just ahead of The Dark Eyes of London, is The Door with 7 Locks. I&#39;m not sure the mystery holds completely together, but it is a great pulp set up. Seven keys are being held by seven rather unscrupulous individuals, all of whom worked for a deceased lord whose son is supposed to inherit everything on his twenty-first birthday. The seven keys fit into seven locks which open a door in a castle, but what is behind that door? Scotland Yard inspector Dick Martin comes into the case after the murder of two of the key holders. Martin romances Sybil, a librarian distantly related to the deceased lord and banters with his superior Sir John and the comic relief. This comic relief is once again played by Eddi A-r-e-n-t (no apostrophe in his name, auto-correct). Here, he is playing an inspector who, in spite of having the last name of &quot;Holmes,&quot; has less than stellar deduction skills. However, the two most welcome returning actors are Pinkas Braun, the dashing villain from Secret of the Red Orchid and Ady Berber, the Tor Johnson lookalike who played Blind Jack in The Dead Eyes of London. Here, Berber&#39;s character Giacco strikes such fear into an intended victim that just hearing his name causes the target to grab a Sten Submachine gun and start blasting. I do not know how close the film is to the source material, but the film is a highly enjoyable mystery. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski is bumped off too early.

Whose idea was it to get Columbus Short to resume the role? The guy in the 1st movie was a faaaaar better actor. Like the storyline was amazing, so how did this happen? A great cast means more than pretty faces and nice bodies. The scenes were so dry and unbelievably BORING!! I was on the edge of my seat for the 1st movie. I fell asleep on this one. It&#39;s obvious the production budget on this one went to cover the aesthetics. I would rather have watched Life peddle out of another shabby motel than to watch poor acting from a big house with fancy cars. The only scene that came as a surprise was 6 minutes intk the movie. In relation to the prior reviews, I have to shed some truth before someone else loses another hour and a half that they can&#39;t get back.","Life is a career criminal who desires to get out of the dope game and go legitimate.

This rather lightweight entry is less risqué than usual for Jim, because the star performers are generally well-known and perhaps a bit long-in-the-tooth for their roles.When the parents leave, our five heroines carry on out of control, immediately stripping down to their undies to trade stories around the fireplace (think campfire if this were an outdoor picture).An obscene phone call sets the tone of grotesque humor, as we&#39;re treated to closeups of the pervert on the other end of the line jerking off. The vignettes inspired by the kids&#39; imagination begin with a campy scene of sex in an Arab tent starring Wade Nichols as The Shiek. Buxom Terri Hall is dancing around on an abstract set, making love to a fireman and having mixed combo troilism with the addition of Black lead Barbi Jay. Next Michael Gaunt appears for a quality oral sex scene, followed by Barbi again in a lesbian sex bout.C.J. Laing phones a pimp named Daddy Joe, cuing a fantasy of her having sex with one of his whores and also performing her patented deep throat technique on DJ. Fun wrinkle is that the pimp looks a lot like current new-star Oscar Isaac.C.J. then has mixed combo action with a big-dicked Black guy, getting kinky by shoving a dildo up his posterior. The next fantasy of a muscular guy deflowering a little girl is obviously over the line and features anal sex.The parents cone home none too soon, finding the girls in the living room all peacefully asleep - no one&#39;s the wiser.","",""

He had an enormous screen presence &amp; personality &amp; he could&#39;ve easily became a leading actor if he really wanted to but he was content in small &amp; distinguished supporting roles. He was quite versatile &amp; is often associated with John Wayne in the John Ford directed films. Ward Bond was literally in just about every film to name a few like &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934) he was an extra in &quot;G-Men&quot; (1935) &quot;Night Key&quot; with Boris Karloff (1937), &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), &quot;Prison Break&quot; with Barton Maclane (1938), &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; (1939) he was an extra in &quot;Son Of Frankenstein&quot; (1939), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), &quot;It&#39;s A Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), &quot;Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye&quot; with James Cagney (1950) etc. He was in hundred&#39;s of movies.He often played cops &amp; gangsters &amp; I thought he did a good job in the leading role of the patriotic gangster. The cast is solid with established actors like Paul Fix &amp; Warren Hymer who often played stupid gangsters. Sure the plot is far fetched but it was 1942 &amp; WW2 was a very popular war inspiring national patriotism. The film was obviously a wartime moral booster while at the same time trying to sustain &amp; save a dying genre: the gangster film &amp; in 1942 what better way to sell a gangster movie than to turn the gangsters into patriotic American hero&#39;s on an improbable mission to knock off Adolf Hitler. It may be a little campy today but in it&#39;s day this movie was probably taken seriously by 1942 audiences. Think about it, the film was obviously intended to be serious &amp; it&#39;s not a bad watch &amp; I would watch it again &amp; it&#39;s by far superior to the Ed Wood films.There is really no comparison &amp; there is a lot worse movies out there than this. Don&#39;t forget Ed Wood was voted the worst director of all time, an honor &amp; title he fittingly deserves. It doesn&#39;t get any worse than Ed Wood not even an Elvis Presley movie.","A team of ex-con bounty hunters go to Germany in search of Hitler.

Its worth watching once! Once was enough for me because I hated all the characters and was left depressed after watching a movie where people are constantly fighting but that- I think is the point of the film.","A story about a young woman, Vera, who is somebody, living the life of a troubled teenager in the time right before the end of the Soviet Union.

I was fully expecting to hate this film given Logan Paul(Blake) and the annoying angry girl from Cobra Kai, Peyton List(Laina) are the stars and it seems to have quite a low budget,however I have to admit they were surprisingly good in this film and its actually quite a solid movie
Stacey Dash gives a reliable performance as the helpless teacher as does Mathew Glade(sen Redding) as senator and presidential hopeful who also happens to be Blake&#39;s dad and main antagonist of the film
Paul and list star as students in a dystopian &quot;what if?&quot;America that has decided that the only way to curb overpopulation is to cull all the dead weight by testing school kids and bumping off all the ones that fail the thinning exams.Reminds me of a teenage version of the purge crossed with the maze runner series
A different spin on the usual post apocalyptic future when resources are scarce
Only real fault with this film is you don&#39;t actually see any of the suffering or resource shortages that would require a culling so that opportunity to soak it all in and understand the thinning isnt there.Its no Oscar winner but if you&#39;re looking for some sci fi entertainment with a bit of action thrown in,then this will do the trick!**There is also a decent sequel and talk of a 3rd installment.","""The Thinning"" takes place in a future plagued by overcrowding where population control is dictated by a high-school aptitude test.

Sutherland and Phillips are always fun to watch, although Phillips is maybe a bit too stoic from time to time. The finale is high on the body count, which is all we can ask from many of these &#39;80s action setpieces. If it all looks a bit dated now, especially Sutherland&#39;s funky-chicken hairdo, so be it. They can&#39;t all be DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON.

After all, it presents some aspects of human sexuality that clearly will offend some and the film is filled with nudity. However, it is very well made in interesting throughout.The picture begins with a lovely montage in which you see two young girls, Laura and Claire, as they meet, become best friends, spend their adolescent, teen and adult lives together. Each marries and Laura has a baby...and things look great. But then the young mother, Laura, dies and naturally everyone is bereft.Some time passes and Claire (Anaïs Demoustier) goes to check in on Laura&#39;s husband, David (Romain Duris) and is shocked to find that he is dressed as a woman. He makes an excuse that he&#39;s dressed like a woman to make it easier for the baby...but it soon becomes clear that he&#39;s been dressing like a woman for years....just not publicly. Through the course of the film, David/Virginia and Claire become close friends...very close friends. She helps him play the role of Virginia better but there is a problem...Claire&#39;s own sexuality is uncertain. She fantasizes about David being gay, though throughout the film he appears straight...even when he is Virginia. But her own feelings and orientation are quite vague.The film explores the wide range of human sexuality and experience and does it quite well. It is very well acted and directed. My only qualm is one flashback scene where you see David undressing and caressing his dead wife...it&#39;s pretty disturbing and unnecessary. Overall, a well made film that leaves lots and lots of questions unanswered and might also leave the viewer a bit disturbed as well.","Claire and Laura have been friends since primary school.

TINT told us about a female radio announcer whose have a midnight show and being terrorized by her caller called The Hungry Wolf whose claim him self as putting a bomb is several public area. And the bomb explodes eventually. To solve this case, she&#39;s work with a clueless cop and sadly it does also start the clueless events during the entire movie!We really should never judge a book by its cover. TINT seem have a good premise to be a fine thriller (based on the title and premise). But, the fact is this movie is elaborated more on the comedic side! TINT even doesn&#39;t have any clear main plot. It got no any suspense at all! It does have some thrill but not satisfying enough. On the contrary, it more is focusing on romantic comedy side, which actually doesn&#39;t really need for this movie.Apart from the dull concept, actually this movie is fun to watch. I have a mucho good laugh over it. We can classify this into bad-but-entertaining type. Even though I will not watch it again in a near future, but I think I could still enjoy it.4/10","A female radio announcer gets terrorized by a caller named The Hungry Wolf, who claims him self as putting bombs in several locations.

It is rare to find such an insightful work that deals with the stereotypes of gay culture. Eric is an ex hockey player and Sam is a lawyer, they are a very conservative couple. Scot recently orphaned after his mother dies from an overdose, is unexpectedly dropped into their lives. He is very flamboyant and the total opposite of his new caregivers. While very funny this gem is also heartwarming, believable and thought provoking. As the story unfolds the three realize that acceptance and love are the glue that binds a family and overcomes all obstacles. Excellent writing, cinematography and casting make this film a must see and earn it the perfect score of a 10. Bravo to Mr. Lynd and the talented cast!","The hockey career of former Toronto Maple Leaf Eric McNally, who was known as a tough enforcer, came to an end with a shoulder injury. He is now a sportscaster. Except to his assistant Nula, what he hasn't told his work colleagues is that he is gay and that he is in a long term relationship with a sports lawyer named Sam. Eric feels that he can't be openly gay as an ex-hockey player or as a public figure still associated with professional hockey. Eric and Sam's life is turned upside down when they take temporary custody of Scot Latour, whose drug addict mother, Julie, recently passed away from a drug overdose. Julie assigned custody of Scot to her ex-boyfriend, Billy, who is Sam's deadbeat brother. Sam is certain that Billy will eventually come for Scot when he learns that Julie's insurance money also comes with custody. Having only had Julie's influence in his life, Scot is a flamboyant adolescent, who wears make-up, a feather boa and his mother's charm bracelet, and who loves musicals and singing Christmas carols. As they all wait for Billy's arrival, Eric, despite not being Scot's father, and Scot have to figure out how to come to terms with each other - Scot being a boy who expresses himself freely whatever the consequences, and Eric always being concerned about maintaining a macho exterior - within their temporary guardian/charge relationship. —Huggo",""

My advice is to watch the film...and try to look past the implausibility of the story.When the film begins, you see that there are identical twin brothers (both played by Frederic March) who are nothing like each other in personalities or their lifestyles. Arthur is a bitter and unlikable Egyptologist who doesn&#39;t seem to care about others. Buddy is a poor guy who is more a &#39;normal Joe&#39;. And, it seems that when their rich father died, he inexplicably gave his entire fortune to the bitter Egyptologist.One day the poor brother goes to see his brother. The Egyptologist is cold and nasty and tells his poor brother that when he dies, he&#39;s leaving his money for Egyptological research and giving him nothing! But, after telling him this, the nasty brother suffers a fatal heart attack. So, the nice brother, Buddy, pretends to be his brother and tells authorities that Buddy had died...and he assumes the nasty brother&#39;s life. Can he maintain this ruse? After all, the nasty brother&#39;s friends, research, associates and girlfriend are all unknown to Buddy. And, will there be any complications? And, could the brother&#39;s life actually be worse than poor Buddy&#39;s?If this plot seems familiar, well...it is. Later Bette Davis films like &quot;A Stolen Life&quot; and &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; cover the same sort of material. However, unlike the Davis films, &quot;Strangers in Love&quot; has a more comedic bent.Overall, I think I prefer this movie to the Davis films. I think the main reason is the writing, as &quot;Strangers in Love&quot; is more lighthearted and doesn&#39;t take itself so seriously. Plus, while Davis is a fantastic actress, Frederic March wasn&#39;t exactly a slouch when it came to acting!By the way, don&#39;t let your head explode when Buddy calls his maid &#39;Snowball&#39;. Yes, it is VERY demeaning and wrong, but was a sign of the times in which the movie was made.","A 1932 American Pre-Code comedy film directed by Lothar Mendes and written by Grover Jones, William J.

Otherwise, you probably won&#39;t.There are only two things that raise it even slightly out of the muck: Nat Pendleton and the girl he is chasing, Una Merkel.Nat Pendleton, of whom I am a fan and have enjoyed as the dumb cop in many other films, is funny here, but not given much to work with, even though his part is bigger than usual. Mostly he grumpily gives orders to the enlisted men. His &quot;repartee&quot; with Ted Healy is without exception annoying. In fact, the main idea of &quot;comedy&quot; in this movie seems to be sailors yelling at one another, something that happens again and again.Una Merkel, who was wonderful in The Bank Dick (1940), is the other highlight, although she is quite different here from the sweet innocent she played in that film. Her rough, low-life character is not particularly likable (although it is very enjoyable to watch), and she has too little on-screen time to come anywhere near saving the film.Robert Taylor, at the peak of his youthful handsomeness, doesn&#39;t do much except stand around looking macho and break up the sailors who are yelling at each other. His girlfriend, played by Jean Parker, is repulsive throughout. I couldn&#39;t imagine what he saw in her. Money, I guess.Arthur Byron is also good as the captain, but it is barely more than a cameo role. He does manage to give the spoiled Jean Parker a good lecture, though.Taylor doesn&#39;t solve the case. He literally stumbles on the perp, who, to my sorrow, turned out to be one of the only other likable characters in the film.A few great wisecracks from John Hyams as a fed-up husband. He has the only line in the whole movie that made me laugh out loud.All in all, not worth the time it takes to watch it.","Taylor is cast as Lt.

It may be a bit far-fetched at times but the erotic content in this movie is fantastic, especially Deborah Shelton. She plays Roxy, the ex-girlfriend of insurance CEO Ted Quincy (Matt Roe) who wants her back and her husband dead in order to collect the insurance. The plot is a bit convoluted but the obvious standout scene is the one with Miss Shelton and Nick Cassavetes, Jack, the ex-con insurance investigator who is - sorry, no spoilers. A mention also goes to Michele Brin who plays the suspected insurance fraudster early in the film. It is a pity we do not see more of her.Despite the praise for this film mentioned above, two stars have been deducted because I feel that there were missed opportunities for more erotic content; Michele Brin mentioned above; Courtney Taylor has legs to die for so we could have seen more; and there is a hint of a girl/girl relationship.

She&#39;s trying to move into the big time of evangelism and envisions a church out in the sticks like John Hagee has in San Antonio.

Is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle-aged, shopworn, and gun-shy, rather than oversexed teen-stars? Could be. If you&#39;re over 35, you&#39;ll probably get this comedy. If you&#39;re over 45, you&#39;re really going to get this comedy. If you&#39;re 25, wait until you&#39;re older to see it.The unlikely pairing of Matthau and Jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely. There&#39;s a wonderful line of Matthau&#39;s that sums up what is happening between the two of them--&quot;I like old broads because you don&#39;t have to explain who Ronald Colman is.&quot; (If that&#39;s not the exact line, it&#39;s close...)The premise of a sub-par hospital run by incompetents rings true. Art Carney&#39;s portrayal of a senile head surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery. Subplots, if you can call them that, are fun too, like the one with Jackson&#39;s teenage son and Matthau. Everything hits just exactly the right tone. Okay, there&#39;s the bit where Matthau has to wear women&#39;s clothing that&#39;s a bit over-the-top and an easy mark. But, still--it&#39;s Walter Matthau in drag!

Punished for hitting German soldiers he is locked in solitary confinement.In his brief appearance as a priest, Cedric Hardwicke shines as a brave, defiant messenger of the Lord.

Another way is the use of contemporary preachers, theologians, and believers commenting upon the various themes of Puritanism - and how those themes are applicable to the Christian life today.
A third way this is done is through the use of an artistic style that is unique and wonderful to look at. The various depictions of historical figures and events from King Henry to the Mayflower; the marks of Puritanism to waxing and waning of Puritanism throughout history - are illustrated in ways that capture the attention of the viewer.Clearly everyone involved in this film (and the accompanying products) cared very much about it&#39;s release and it shows.

As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney &amp; Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt&#39;s older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager &amp; counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt&#39;s imagination, ensuring Disney&#39;s immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey&#39;s screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt&#39;s growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt&#39;s genius was unbeatable. Mickey&#39;s feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt&#39;s grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a blizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi &amp; Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.","A young boy dreams of being a cowboy.

This should have been a lost film, so people could speculate (or half-remember) about its contents, rather than still exist as a total insult to the viewer.Picture might have served as a time capsule of a hedonistic period in America, set at the West Coast&#39;s epicenter for narcissism and public sex. Instead, we get an anti-erotic load of b.s. with big-name porn talent rather than &quot;real people&quot; cavorting in one long orgy.The irritating Bill Margold (a superstar in his own mind whose name never sold a single ticket during his lengthy porn hanger-on career) is the villain of the piece, managing Plato&#39;s Retreat West with the mayor&#39;s daughter Vicky (Maria Tortuga) as resident dominatrix and fellow baddie. Editor Burt Saxon (Mike Ranger) is there to supervise an undercover investigation, assigning reporters (!) Seka and Lisa DeLeeuw to uncover incriminating material linking the mayor and Plato&#39;s for an explosive newspaper story.The gals see a lot of sexual activity but fail to come up with conclusive goods (in today&#39;s internet media environment the half-baked story would have been disseminated immediately) so they peddle their reportage to a femme editor who demands sex from DeLeeuw in return, that leads to a fake-rough lesbian scene, and then reneges on publishing.Meanwhile a portly semi-retarded guy named Willard (unidentified and untalented actor, who seems to be doubled below the waist during sex scenes) is trying to get laid by one of the dozens of nude women humping all comers on the premises, and in a dumb incest subplot ends up humping his mother &quot;inadvertently&quot; (credibility is not helped by casting Willard to look older than his mom).Idiotic finish has Margold confronting Ranger with a gun only to be outflanked by Tortuga and a sudden freeze-frame with literally 50%-plus of the plot voiced over by narration attempting to tie together many of the loose ends in a script credited to Sherman&#39;s partner in crime &quot;John Finegold&quot;. Film takes an anti-gay stance early on, with the statement that while women are freely admitted, Plato&#39;s West requires male customers to bring a woman with them &quot;in order to cut down on the number of gays&quot;. But of course it is primarily misogynistic, with a &quot;cute&quot; recurring motif emphasized by Margold of a woman sucking cock constantly with blank-eyed expression imitating a sex doll. Margold&#39;s smug, smarmy personality dominates the film and helps sink it from the outset.Sex scenes aren&#39;t arousing at all, especially a &quot;climax&quot; where Willard is humped by several beauties as the rest of the cast cheers him on. Basically we are treated to decadence with a capital D, meant to conjure up ancient Rome rather than Greece. Naked people disco dancing en masse, and the presumably fabricated &quot;allure&quot; of the fantasy room where more sex can be done privately and anonymously, plus a brief masked slasher attacking DeLeeuw subplot all turn out to be 100% boring under Sherman&#39;s limp direction.Ranger was briefly typecast in this type of movie having made Ray Dennis Steckler&#39;s similar SEX RINK years before, reprised in the later paste-up job by Steckler titled PLATO&#39;s RETREAT WEST. Fortunately for Ranger, Kirdy Stevens cast him as the young lead opposite Kay Parker in TABOO, giving him an indelible place in film history, not unlike Keir Dullea&#39;s lucky casting in Kubrick&#39;s 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.","Investigative reporters go undercover to get the dirt on the infamous sex club Plato's.Investigative reporters go undercover to get the dirt on the infamous sex club Plato's.",""

The story begins on the night of the accident and culminates in present day. The viewer follows the compelling story of Kim beginning with her family&#39;s decision not to end life support through her roller coaster ride of recovery. Kim and her family face many hurdles, most of which are exacerbated by inadequate insurance coverage, Medicare limitations, understaffed physical therapy and nursing home facilities and Kim&#39;s continued penchant for making bad decisions. The story is told honestly and though the young woman at it&#39;s center does not always inspire sympathy, her family does. It is interesting to witness their own struggles with this series of events that Kim has brought into their lives. I watched this doc online and never once thought about pausing and taking a break. Indeed, I wish it had been a little longer. It is very well made from a technical perspective. The music was memorable and I believe all original. When it was over, it took me a few days to fully wrap my brain around this film. My first thought was that I didn&#39;t know what to think. I wasn&#39;t sure if this film was about Kim and her family or if it was about politically hot issues such as Medicare and health insurance. I came to realize that for me, this film was about a family and their struggles and their triumphs. They are dealing with an insurmountable stack of hospital bills and a daughter(sister, girlfriend) who is in bad shape and realistically may never make a full recovery. This is a story that any one of us could find ourselves in through no fault of our own. The experience they have with hospitals and insurance is just a fact of their lives and the documentary shows us that without making judgment of the system. I think I am used to documentaries where the director has a very clear point of view. These docs are usually pretty entertaining but I can&#39;t help but feel that while watching them, I&#39;m actually watching propaganda. Redemption Of The Fall managed to be entertaining without stirring up the base on politically polarizing issues. I for one appreciated this approach.","A woman fell from the fourth floor of a Park City condominium in 2008. She was in a coma for 11 months.

The short takes us to various places in the Far East including various palaces in Siam, the Temple of 500 Buddhas in Japan and a visit to the Pearl River in China. The film might lack the Technicolor but the B&amp;W cinematography is one of the real high points as the visual look of the film is quite nice. All of the places we visit actually look very good in their B&amp;W but a few of the places, like Siam, were later visited by FitzPatrick and his crew. What doesn&#39;t work is the narration and some of the stuff we&#39;re told. We&#39;re given very little information on the places we visit and what we are told is often times laughable. For example, when we visit China we&#39;re told that what we&#39;re looking at is as &quot;Chinese&quot; as China can get. Oh, really?

Although travel by railroad has replaced the traditional travel by elephant, the white elephant is still considered a sacred animal. Porcelain and gold towers and statues of guards dot the residential palace. The next stop is Cairo, Egypt, the largest city on the banks of the Nile River and a city filled with mosques, minarets and domes. Ancient ruins and the great pyramids can be found just outside of the city. The next stop is Madras, India, whose residents are better educated than the average Indian. The next stop is Calcutta, India, where a marble palace honors the late Queen Victoria. The grounds of another palace, home to one of the richest Indian princes, is open to the public to enjoy when he is not in residence. The final stop is the walled city of Delhi, India. The Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in the country. A new capital city for India is being constructed on the outskirts of the existing Delhi. —Huggo",""

Even the score seem to connect perfectly with this dark comedy. I found this movie to have its strange mix of wit and dark humor which blends perfectly. This is one bizarre tale of an auditor from Revenue Canada who enters a strange town, with strange inhabitants and one strange apartment complex. We have a mix of small town inhabitants with sadistic humor and odd behaviors as we see this Revenue Canada outsider become unfortunately intertwined within the lust, greed and corruption that surrounds this small tightly knit community with arcane behaviors. This is a drama/ dark comedy that isn&#39;t for everyone. However, if you like dark and strange cult like films, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll find &quot;The Michelle Apartments&quot; as one of those films. If you are for more happy and brightly atmospheric films, this film may not be your ticket.

When the oil bubble on the Vernon property burst, he returns to find the place encumbered with debt. To pay it off he enters a horse race. Bush, who holds the mortgage, is trying to foreclose, having secret information about the land. He conspires to keep Bud out of the race and lays heavy bets, knowing that Bud is the only formidable rival. Four men jump on Bud as he leaves the Vernon home at night. They take him to a secluded cabin and lock him in. However, Bud's horse finds the place and breaks down the door. When the race is about to start, Bud rides up and flabbergasts the opposition. After a thrilling ride, he wins the race, at the end of which he pulls Bush from his horse and administers a sound thrashing. Subsequently, oil seepage is found on the Vernon ranch and the boom is on again, with Bud and Molly happy together.","[{""names"":[],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[],""title"":""Writers""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010134"",""name"":""Art Acord""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942039"",""name"":""Fay Wray""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0380647"",""name"":""Aggie Herring""}],""title"":""Stars""}]","","","[{""actor"":""Art Acord"",""character"":""Bud Harris"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010134""},{""actor"":""Fay Wray"",""character"":""Molly Vernon"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942039""},{""actor"":""Aggie Herring"",""character"":""Mrs. Vernon"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0380647""},{""actor"":""William Steele"",""character"":""Frank Lambert"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0824700""},{""actor"":""Al J.

At the start of the film Mark is put out by his wife of 12 months because she has fallen out of love of him. Living out of his car for a short time, Mark is not deterred by the hurts in his life by his dream of not only becoming a wrestler but also making it to the top of British Professional Wrestling circuit. However given that he is unable to take any sort of pain, has pasty skin and weighs 9 stone things do not look that good.Shawn Meadows is hard to put a finger on, with this film being different from the other films of his that I have seen (which were different enough in comparison to themselves). I expected some sort of morbid and realistic look at Nottingham life but was very pleasantly surprised by a &#39;documentary&#39; film that is delivered with such a bittersweet comedy that it is hard not to love it. The film starts with a scene that is a little sad and comes across as acted, but then mixes &#39;to camera&#39; stuff where Mark talks to director Shane as well as other scenes that are not done in a documentary style. The actual plot can be viewed as maybe being about the lack of real dreams in Nottingham and, in that way, it certainly works and is very true  can you imagine a similar film coming out of America? The land where dreams are always obtainable! With this very British, low key approach the film proves itself to be a winner  a contender if you will.The film is pretty funny for the first half, and features a painfully real (and painfully funny) wrestling match in a pub but then it is also rather sad. The sadness is perhaps too easily added by quite an ordinary (but nice) song from Clayhill, who Mark finds playing in a working mans&#39; club. This still works though and the rather sweet tragedy of Mark; certainly the ending is bittersweet and backs up the &#39;dreams in the Midlands&#39; side of the plot by showing that really all many of us can really aim for is to be settled. It is effective and I imagine that British viewers with British sensibilities will be easily won over by it.Overall this is a very enjoyable short film that will appeal to those of us that live pleasant, but low key little lives. Shorn of all the glamour and shouting that would accompany any American film about big dreams this is a sweet little film that is funny as well as a little touching. Well worth seeing as a company piece to Meadow&#39;s full features.","This is a mockumentary following the story of Mark Sherbert.

as the saviour of her terminally ill dependant.This challenging and ambitious piece of film making asks you to consider the scales upon which your own religious beliefs, if any, contrast against those who place an unyielding faith in a god and those who are cursed and beholden to their electrochemical industry that unbalances and destabilises their brain, body and soul.","There but for the grace of God goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere--but before long, Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist,"" further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure. —Toronto International Film Festival",""

It was screened in Malaysia in 1971. I was then 15 years old. Many of my friends at that time were already Hindi movie fans and persuaded me to watch. They told me about good songs, handsome heroes and beautiful heroines. Finally when Pyar Ka Mausam was screened in my hometown, I decided to go to the cinema. That was really the turning point for me. I was glued to the screen, enjoyed the songs by Mohd. Rafi and Lata, and was fascinated with the handsome Shashi Kapoor and beautiful Asha Parekh. They are my favourite stars until now. Since then I never missed Hindi films that came to town, especially if the films had Shashi and Asha in it, or either one of them. Old Hindi movies are sold in VCD&#39;s in Malaysia and of course Pyar Ka Mausam is in my collection. I will always cherish this film and remember it in my heart. I wish I could tell Shashi and Asha about this. But how could I? I am far away and I don&#39;t know how to get in touch with them. Nevertheless, my best regard and best wishes to my hero and heroine.","Seema is the only child of widowed Mohan, who is adopted by Mohan's boss, Sardar Ranjit Singh, who has no heir to his estate, as his daughter, Jamuna, eloped with a much poor peasant, Gopal, as well as Ranjit does not get well with his step-brother, Shankar.

The documentary shows us the atrocities carried out by some dictators, and is not a personal attack to you, zvesda, or to the citizens of Russia, whether old or young (not to mention those crimes were against the Soviet Union&#39;s own citizens!).

Whatever dictatorship that might be, at the shadow of whatever ideology.

television and then it disappeared. I enjoyed it a lot, especially Cesar Romero and Connie Stevens. I had wandered over here from Connie Stevens&#39; biography.The viewing I remember most occurred in 1975. I was in Harbor General Hospital in Torrance, California (Los Angeles County). I had just given birth to twin girls a day or two previous; new mothers and babies were kept in the hospital for three days back then. The babies weren&#39;t kept in the room with us. Being a county/teaching hospital they didn&#39;t put extras like TVs in the rooms and there were four beds to a room. One of the gals brought her 13&quot; b/w set complete with rabbit ears. Since it was across the room on the other side from me on the window sill, I sat on the edge of another new mommy&#39;s bed and watched it.Reading various areas of this title I&#39;ve found out it&#39;s out on DVD. I&#39;ll have to see about getting hold of it and see if I still enjoy it as much as I remember. I always got a kick out of that kind of movie. They never really took themselves seriously. Vincent Price appeared in a lot of those and it wouldn&#39;t have been surprising if he&#39;d been in it instead of Romero. Would have been right up his alley.","The spitting image of her mother at that age, early twenty-something Cassie Duquesne never really knew her parents, Duke and Melinda Duquesne, having been sent to live with her aged maternal aunt in Wisconsin after Melinda abandoned the family when Cassie was an infant, Melinda's whereabouts since unknown. Twenty years ago, Duke and Melinda were at the top of the profession as a magician - The Great Duquesne - and his on-stage assistant respectively, they specializing in illusions of the macabre and gore. Cassie reenters the realm of her father's life when she returns to Los Angeles to attend his funeral, which is as theatrical as his life in that he vowed in his life to emerge from the dead. Beyond this issue, Cassie learns that she is the sole beneficiary of her father's $300,000 estate, with which those arguably closest to him, Buzz Sheridan and Dolly Bast, his longtime manager and housekeeper respectively, are outwardly all right in Duke's want to bring Cassie back, she who they state he loved from afar despite Cassie's belief that he never loved her in not seeking her out in life. There is one caveat to Cassie getting that inheritance: she must live for seven consecutive nights - midnight to dawn - in her father's isolated mansion. Getting over her initial antagonism toward him, Cassie is able to navigate through most of the unexpected occurrences in the mansion with the help of a man she meets, Val Henderson, they determining those occurrences all part of the illusions of the Great Duquesne's professional life. Cassie is however unaware that Val is really a reporter out to get a story. As more and more terrifying and inexplicable occurrences happen at the house, the questions become if someone is trying to frighten Cassie into losing the inheritance, and/or if the Great Dusquesne really has risen from the dead. The answers may partially be found in the locked room in the house which Cassie cannot get into as the Great Dusquesne had the only key which was buried with him. —Huggo",""

A third is almost nothing but stock footage of seals,dolphins, and various tribes that look nothing alike in different scenes. I was yawning after two minutes of seeing seals wash up on rocks and having inane dialog try and justify its presence. The original films could not have much better though because a couple of these actors - okay, most of these actors are just downright awful from the lead Barry Norton to the excessiveness of Jack Del Rio looking like a psychopath at the ship&#39;s steering wheel to the laughable persona of Jack Barty as the captain to the even more ludicrous native chief with a New York accent. Only the fellow playing Tiny the cook held any of my interest - and that really says just how bad this film is if you saw his performance! I really cannot add much more to this then to say that the film is very, very bad and devoid of any merit whatsoever except if you enjoy watching people pour out their hearts only ending in cinematic misery for the viewer built by the foundation of their lack of talent and competence.

The most fun scenes are when the spider runs amok outside the lab. At this stage in the film, it&#39;s easy to see that the production was given quite a hefty budget to work with, so why not use it to build sets instead of making high school classrooms pass for government labs? And how about a few extras to guard this super-secret facility?Despite its plot-hole writing, less-than-believable visuals, and amazingly cheap looking first three-quarters, the chaotic ending and likeable young cast keep this otherwise unredeemable, derivative film pure camp pleasure.","A DNA experiment on a rare breed of spider is taking place on a NASA space shuttle, when a freak meteor shower engulfs the shuttle, causing everything to go horribly wrong.

It&#39;s beyond solid in my opinion. It&#39;s pretty good action movie.This might be the best action flick I have seen in 2018. It feels very small budgeted yet, this was very action packed, well choreographed and well shot. The music was actually pretty decent...On the Ropes is a pretty good martial arts filmed wrapped up in a gang war scenario. Two brothers on the wrong path and one ends up double crossing the other in a quest to garner power. That&#39;s the plot essentially and all you need to know to enjoy the movie.There is no CGI and that&#39;s a positive in an era overdone with CGI. It was very commendable and enjoyable. If you are a guy who loves action flicks, and wants to see something refreshing, give it a shot. It&#39;s not your cookie cutter action flick, but that&#39;s why it works. Yeah it&#39;s low budget, but so what?Highly recommended for guys who are fans of action movies and martial arts. 9 out of 10. Some actors are better than others, but at no point is this movie boring. Well done production and camera work, along with fast moving plot makes this a must see.","Following the sudden death of their father, two brothers realize the greatest threat to their criminal empire might just be each other.

I had never heard about the movie&#39;s existence, prior to stumbling upon it here late in 2019.I do love the Hong Kong cinema, and thus it took no convincing of me to make me sit down and watch this 1991 movie from director Francis Sung.Turns out that the storyline told in &quot;Beyond&#39;s Diary&quot; was somewhat of a scrambled mess. There simply was too many stories being told all at once, which made it hard to keep track with the different characters and storylines. At a point, I just gave up trying to keep track and just watched the story unfold on the screen.The acting in the movie was adequate, but it was suffering from the storyline being a bit too complex, and from having writers Roman Cheung and Vincent Kok setting out to want to accomplish a little bit too much, especially when director Francis Sung wasn&#39;t fully able to deliver a comprehensive movie.While &quot;Beyond&#39;s Diary&quot; is somewhat watchable, it was just too much to keep up with, and that means that I am rating the movie four out of ten stars. This is hardly an outstanding or memorable movie from the 1990s Hong Kong cinema. Nor is it hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time around.","Chronicles the lives of individuals who are faced with everyday problems.

In a world of insects parallel to that of humans, the police are the spiders, - probably because if they grab you with their 7 legs they have a hard time escaping. And Inspector Sun is the best of them all. Obviously, like any good policeman, he has a lethal archenemy, the fierce and very evil red lobster. When the inspector decides to retire, he embarks on a flight in which a murder occurs. Veteran Inspector Sun (voiced by Ronny Chieng), a lone spider, leads his final mission against his archenemy Red Lobster, before embarking on a well-deserved retirement. His vacation aboard a Pan Am Clipper plane between Shanghai and San Francisco ends abruptly when millionaire Dr. Spindelthorp is found murdered. Throughout the investigation Sun is accompanied by an admiring young fanatic, he&#39;s not thrilled to have a companion in tow, but that&#39;s very much in tune with the need to explain things to the audience as we go. And the main suspect is the Black Widow, who is consequently locked up. As a seven-legged spider, Sun has his hands, or rather his legs, busy trying to find out who did it and why. Inspector Sun has his work cut out for him tracking down his archenemy Red Locust, a supervillain who believes in the hive mentality; &quot;Long live the swarm&quot; is his mantra, while Sun prefers a more individual approach when it comes to insect philosophy. What begins as a routine case for Sun will ultimately decide the fate of humanity. Thus the fate of the world of insects remains in the hands - or paws - of the notorious police inspector.The current interest in detective films has given us some unconventional ones worth watching, so here the kids have their own super-detective: Inspector Sun, being based on the Samuel Goldwyn award-winning screenplay. An original rather than imported premise starring Inspector Sun, a Hercule Poirot type of detective including his mustache and classic clothing, he is an arachnid who is searching for clues in 1934 Shanghai, this animation that originally came from Spain, but which has been picked up and dubbed for family audiences in the U. S. That means we have a lot of precedent; We&#39;re remembering the type of storytelling that created Charlie Chan, Sexton Blake, famous writers like Sax Rohmer, Agatha Christie and others, bringing up this colorful film aiming to translate this detective energy to a wide audience of all ages. And even from a childhood point of view, recalling classic cartoon movies like Scooby Doo when it comes to the lost art of solving crimes. Here Sun boards a passenger plane heading to San Francisco and in its cargo a parallel universe of all kinds of insects is created, but when there is a murder, he has to discover which of the various suspicious characters he knows is responsible and, therefore, Of course, there is the ordinary meeting of the main suspects in the crime and finally, after much deliberation, Inspector Sun/Poirot will decide who the murderer is. All of these twisted criminal events lead to a spectacular finale, with a swarm of giant lobsters attacking Alcatraz Island being one of the best parts of the film.This fun, original and funny family film was nominated for the Goya award for best animation in 2023. It is a Spanish production well and professionally made by director Julio Soto Gurpide, he believes that children should have their own artistic cinema, but keep them away from the usual superheroes and science fiction tropes and this &#39;Inspector Sun and the Curse of the Black Widow (2022)&#39; could be a good start; acceptably directing the film in an atmosphere of a crime novel in the purest style of Agatha Christie that is reminiscent of her most popular novels, and even the inspector himself is a reflection of the mythical Hercule Poirot.This a cut above most animations in terms of color and character, a mystery film that should entertain young and old alike. And although the adaptation sometimes leaves some practical questions unanswered, it turns out to be an acceptable and passable entry in the 3D animation genre that nevertheless failed at the box office.","After being fired from his detective job after a mission gone awry, Inspector Sun boards a seemingly normal plane for a much-needed vacation. When Dr. Spindlethorp receives a threat on his life, Sun is back on the case. Trapped in a web of lies, Sun must find his suspect before it's too late.After being fired from his detective job after a mission gone awry, Inspector Sun boards a seemingly normal plane for a much-needed vacation.

It takes documentary material and gives it a dramatic core.What is so good is that it takes you to where you have not been before. at the films centre is the simple humanist story of a woman forced to face her prejudice about the travelling community. She arrives after a drunken night out to discover that her boyfriend has bought into the local Klondike. The film reveals her, Betty&#39;s,journey of discovery and realisation as she is forced to engage with the women she originally claimed were &quot;living like animals&quot;. The sub text is the analysis of capitalism where dog eats dog and winner takes all. It is set in the time of the miners strike of 1984 and the irony is clear to see. Not that the film is heavy handed, in fact the opposite is true, and the interface between actors and none actors is almost seamless.","Betty and her daughter Corinna are introduced to the harsh seacoaling way of life by Ray, an ex-seacoaler returning from a job with ICI. His offer of a caravan on a cliff top and promises of the Klondyke that awaits them at least seem preferable to the violent marriage she has left behind. The film sets Betty's struggle for survival against the wider struggles of the seacoaling community, surviving on the fringes of capitalism. Despite the exploitation by a local entrepreneur, run-ins with dole snoops and School Board men and the ever encroaching regulations of a hostile council, their lives retain a kind of anarchic romance, which is reflected in the film's lyrical style. The inspiration for Seacoal undoubtedly came from the staggering visual location in which it is filmed; the industrial landscape of power station and pit framing the blackened beach of Lynemouth where, for generations, local people and travellers have made their living from collecting waste coal washed ashore. Channel 4 wanted a feature film and Amber suggested this territory. A small commission for the Ashington photographer Mik Critchlow in the early 1980s had, in consequence, opened access to the seacoaling community at Lynemouth, where one of Mik's cousins, Trevor Critchlow, worked. The bleak energy of its raw capitalism had often attracted photographers, Chris Killip among them. The caravan Amber bought on the site housed Chris as he developed his photography project, Seacoal (1984), with its stark images of life at the margins. When he moved out, the Amber crew moved in, making a feature film of the same name, which was released the following year. Seacoal, Amber's first feature film represented a major step forward in its experimental mixing of drama and real life. The production team lived with the seacoalers on and off for two years, and the daily events of the camp were incorporated into the film as straight documentary, improvised sketches or fully dramatised reconstructions. Equity, the actors union, granted Amber special concessions to work with the seacoalers themselves on the condition that they did not script for, or direct them. Amber were unable to predict responses to the actors' lines, which meant that the scripting had to be done piecemeal as the plot developed. The technique paid off, however, in terms of the film's spontaneity. After screening on Channel Four, Sean Day Lewis, from the Daily Telegraph, while devoting most of his TV Choice column to this 'haunting unsung film', nevertheless expressed surprise that this was in spite of it being made by Amber Films, 'a co-operative too devoted to equality to acknowledge the existence of a director or cameraman.' —Amber Films",""

I feel it&#39;s a lesser role for Dale compared to other movies of his I&#39;ve seen such as Golden Girl (1951) which was a very good role for him to star in.Thelma Ritter too is a favorite of mine and here she plays the rich widow, Lucy Cashdollar, who plans on having a husband No. 6.

They needed some time to help them forget how bad of a movie they made. The basics of filmmaking were ignored in making this movie. It would have been much better to market this film as comical action or campy, but when they feel they made a serious film, it&#39;s just delusional and sad. I would be embarrassed to put this out there.Aside from the opening scene, the writing, acting, and actions sequences are all horrible and laughable. The editing and framing of these scenes are very awkward as well. The director tries to distract the viewer by having Rachel run around in underwear or a bra. She looks like a puppet and has limited acting range. Rib looks like a soap opera star looking to extend his career. His dream sequence with Rachel is cringy and sophomoric at best.The action sequences are silly and sloppy, and the villains are laughably incompetent and allow themselves to be killed as if they never had any fighting or combat experience. I like how Rib was able to take out a sniper by spinning around with a handgun, ha ha. Rachel character was so dumb she couldn&#39;t undo the ratcheting strap holding her down when her wrists were held together with zip ties but her fingers and arms were free!It&#39;s clear they casted Rachel to draw her social media followers to watch this movie. It will probably be the only people who watch this film. What I can&#39;t understand is why Rachel would sign on to more films with this silly production company.","Posing as hunters, a group of terrorists are in search of $100 million that was stolen and lost in a plane crash en route from Afghanistan.Posing as hunters, a group of terrorists are in search of $100 million that was stolen and lost in a plane crash en route from Afghanistan.",""

However it did have certain aspects that some viewers might appreciate. You&#39;ve heard enough about the bad in other reviews I&#39;m sure, so I&#39;ll be as unbiased as I can and sum up the good, the bad, and the ugly and point out who would and wouldn&#39;t appreciate it.First off this film is for Guys (mainly), and it is for viewers who want to see some nice eye candy as it&#39;s filled with beautiful woman including one topless / ass scene and many other sexual scenes. It plays as a horror / action thriller with some suspense. The action scenes are okay, with some decent special effects. It wasn&#39;t that suspenseful as it&#39;s not that scary (I didn&#39;t think) though not a movie for young kids either as the whole movie is of a sexual nature also involving some non graphic killings. Obviously target audience is viewers in their teens / early twenties and though I&#39;m a few years older I thought it was okay. I rented it cause I have a blockbuster pass and had nothing else to rent (if you can imagine that). I wouldn&#39;t watch it again, and if I did, it would only be to fast forward to certain parts encompassing about 5-10 minutes worth. Overall it&#39;s for guys who want some eye candy and a cheap horror story to string you along. Probably a decent party / date movie for those who want to lighten up the sexual tension (Combo of Species, Scream, and Porkey&#39;s). It&#39;s not as suspenseful or thrilling as scream, but it&#39;s not a spoof like Scary Movie and it more or less tries to take itself seriously.The story itself sounds like something from a porno movie. A race of alien woman are dying off as they no longer can reproduce, so they come to earth and &#39;Decoy&#39; themselves as beautiful woman in attempt to impregnate hosts or men in an effort to revitalize their species. Very similar to Species. Problem is they keep killing the men in the process So the movie is filled with sexual scenes throughout. The two main guys in the movie are new freshmen at some university in a cold state. Keep in mind I did fast forward through some of it and wasn&#39;t paying close attention to minor details. Anyway the guys get involved with your friendly neighborhood Alien beauties. The main character pretty much goes on the vigilante rampage trying to prove the aliens existence. He apparently had a sexual past with the woman detective (which wasn&#39;t really explained). I must say too that the guy detective was probably the worst actor / character, and the film certainly could have survived with out him. What was up with the Puppy stuff??? The other Main guy falls in love with the Alien, and she as well. The movie comes to a head when the main guy hunts the alien women. The acting ranged from decent to terrible, the sexual and eye candy scenes were pretty good, the action was just okay, the special effects were decent. So overall, a B horror flick. You could do worse and if you miss it, no big deal You won&#39;t hear much about it 6 months from now.","In St. John College, freshmen and best friends Luke and Roger meet sexy, blond cousins Lilly and Constance in the laundry of their building.

Murray Abraham (of &quot;Amadeus&quot; fame) were present for Q&amp;A after the movie. The film itself deals with a somewhat dysfunctional family, Sophia Loren in the role of the mother, Abraham plays the father, and their three grown children.Everyone has problems. There&#39;s a lot of shouting and passionate arguing (must be an Italian thing) going on. The plot is simple and there&#39;s a happy end. It takes place at the beautiful Amalfi coast and is a joy to watch. Oddly enough, though, it was shot in English and dubbed into Italian. One would think it should be the other way around. If it ever gets released in the US, we will mostly likely see the original English version.

One might not think it possible, but the people who were sealed off managed to survive. Now, 80 years later, their last living descendant (Hugh Armstrong) is about to make his existence known to the outside world. People start disappearing, but the ball only really gets rolling when a prominent public servant (top character actor James Cossins) vanishes. The chief police inspector on the case, Calhoun (Donald Pleasence), realizes that he has his hands full, but vows to stick it out, despite the matter now being more in the domain of MI5.This marked the debut fictional theatrical feature for the young American director Gary Sherman, who also came up with the story; he went on to direct such nifty 1980s pictures as &quot;Dead &amp; Buried&quot; and &quot;Vice Squad&quot;. He and his crew make excellent use of some *extremely* atmospheric locations. They&#39;re dark, they&#39;re filthy, and they&#39;re dripping with water. &quot;Death Line&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Raw Meat&quot;) can take credit for bringing horror to the London tubes almost a decade before &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. The makeup effects and gore are very well done, and this is additionally blessed with a highly offbeat music score composed by Wil Malone and Jeremy Rose. The camera-work is utterly fantastic - wait for the approximately 10 minute sequence from about 23 minutes in to 33 minutes in for a memorable tracking shot showcasing the monsters&#39; lair.It&#39;s well worth noting that our hideous killer is far from being malicious. He&#39;s really more pitiable than anything else, especially as he goes into mourning at one point, and tries to make a connection with lovely young Patricia Wilson (Sharon Gurney), uttering the only English words that he&#39;s ever managed to learn. You really feel his despair and sadness when it comes to his companion, the Woman (June Turner).Donald Pleasence is an absolute delight in our lead role, playing the material with a heavy dose of humour. His Inspector Calhoun is hilariously surly, and witty. David Ladd (one of Alan Ladds&#39; sons) does okay as American student Alex Campbell, but the character is pretty insensitive and hostile for a while, only earning our sympathy towards the end. Gurney is highly appealing as his girlfriend. Top notch supporting players include Norman Rossington, Clive Swift, Heather Stoney, Hugh Dickson, and Ron Pember. Sir Christopher Lee is great fun to watch, albeit kind of wasted in a cameo role as MI5 agent Stratton-Villiers.Horror fans need to add this one to their watch list, if they haven&#39;t seen it already. It&#39;s too good to pass up.Eight out of 10.","In London, the American college student Alex Campbell and his British girlfriend Patricia Wilson stumble upon a fainted man in the tube stairway in Russell Square. Patricia forces Alex to look for a guard to help the man but when they arrive, the man is gone. When the sarcastic Inspector Calhoun learns that the missing man is an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, he asks Detective Sergeant Rogers to bring the couple to the precinct to confirm that the man was alive. Meanwhile MI5 agent Stratton-Villiers assumes the case and orders Calhoun to leave. However, there are other cases of missing persons in that station and Calhoun proceeds the investigation. What the officers do not know is that there is a cannibal survivor from a collapse in the tunnel in 1892 living in the underground that is kidnapping passengers to feed and to have companionship. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilIn London, the American college student Alex Campbell and his British girlfriend Patricia Wilson stumble upon a fainted man in the tube stairway in Russell Square.

Buddy didn&#39;t last long, being retired in 1935 after 23 cartoons starting in 1933.This is going to be somewhat of a reiteration of some of my previous reviews for the Buddy cartoons, only because most of them have similar strengths and faults. The filmography of Buddy is a mixed bag, some decent ones (none of the cartoons up to &#39;Buddy the Woodsman&#39; were great, even the best ones), some average ones and the odd mediocre one (before this cartoons, this applied to &#39;Buddy&#39;s Show Boat&#39; and &#39;Buddy&#39;s Bearcats&#39;. &#39;Buddy the Woodsman&#39; is one of the average ones. As has been reiterated a few times before, the Buddy cartoons are intriguing to see how very early Looney Tunes characters, before the iconic ones with far more interesting and funnier personalities were introduced, fared.&#39;Buddy the Woodsman&#39; of course has things that are good. The animation is nicely drawn and detailed with the black and white looking crisp. Even better is the music score. Music played a big part in the Buddy cartoons and it was essential for it to work.Although the pacing is inconsistent in &#39;Buddy the Woodsman&#39;, there is some energy and there are some mildly amusing gags, though never hilarious and not particularly inventive or crisply timed. The voice acting is good and a different-looking Cookie is charming. The most interesting character is the bear.However, there are some draggy moments amidst the moments of energy, which does hurt some of the timing of the gags. The ending is predictable and all too convenient, not to mention a little rushed. The story is very thin and formulaic, basically stringing along music and gags, and there is an over-familiarity and repetitiveness at times.Once again, Buddy is a large part of the problem too. He just isn&#39;t a particularly interesting or compelling in personality character, pretty bland actually, and his comic timing is barely there.In conclusion, another one of those watchable but average Buddy cartoons that one watches once for historical interest but without the desire to give it repeat viewings. 5/10 Bethany Cox","A musical number with Buddy in the role of a woodsman.

Muralimohana Rao&#39;s &#39;Taqdeerwala&#39; is a typical campy comedy. The length may exceed over 2.5 hours but much of it is very funny especially the sequences of Kader Khan and Raveena Tandon (which, unfortunately, aren&#39;t that many). The action sequences and dramatic sequences (especially all the crap Suraj does to buy the palace). The special effects are laughably bad. Most of the dialogues in the comedic scenes are hilarious while the rest is boring cliché. The songs are okay at best. &#39;Mera Dil Deewana&#39; is a foot-tapping number visualized on the beautiful Raveena Tandon while the other songs are forgettable. Venkatesh is annoying as the naive Suraj. I get that he&#39;s supposed to be naive but why does he have to act like a kid in every single scene? As the angels of death, Kader Khan and Asrani are a riot. Raveena Tandon is hilarious and provides some of the best laugh-out-loud moments of the movie. Her Lily is one of the funniest film characters. It&#39;s a pity that she has a small role. Reema Lagoo plays the typical Maa in distress. To sum it up, &#39;Taqdeerwala&#39; is a bad movie with some fun moments.","A simpleton Suraj stays in a small house with his widowed mother his friend Pandu and a Gopalji when he was a kid his family owned a huge place known as Swarna palace which went into debts.Suraj has no means of income but he wants to gift back the palace to his mother and can to anything for it doesn't matter if he has to join hands with local goon Chota Raavan.Lily is a rival of Chota Ravan whom Suraj loves but she doesn't care for him.In the universe Yamraj and Chitragupt loose and important book called Bhavishyavani which has details of every human being living on earth the book falls into Suraj's house and his luck starts after he sees his future he soon becomes a millionaire and gifts his mother Swarna palace while Lord Dharma takes all powers of Yamraj and Chitragupt and asks them to go on earth and find the book within a month if they fail all their life they will have to live on earth as human beings.One day Raja opens the book to see his future and is shattered after reading that his mother will die tonight,will Raja be able to save his mother after seeing the future and how will Yamraj and Chitragupt find the book on earth. —alex.mjacko@gmail.com",""

He's got the girl of his dreams. His future couldn't look brighter. But unlike his privileged classmates at Juniper College, Alex is poor as dirt, and comes from a hard-working family. And when his scholarship money runs out, Alex is reduced to borrowing money from his mentor and professor, Dr. Walter Dotson. But when Irwin Marsh, a wealthy and popular (but morally bankrupt) classmate, solicits Alex to write his term paper for him for cash, Irwin simultaneously hands Alex what might be the solution to his financial problems, as Alex soon discovers that his richer and less academic classmates will pay hundreds for the same service. What starts out as a means to some ""easy money"" quickly spirals into a campus-wide paper mill, as word gets out about Alex's new ""service."" Alex soon discovers a newfound power among his peers, admiration from the beautiful female coeds who once ignored him--and a brand new sports car. But Alex is finding that his pleasures come at a price, as his relationship with his girlfriend crumbles, and all hope for a better future slips away before his eyes-after one of his clients gets caught. —Production","$100,000.00"

While the story and cast manage to salvage some aspects of the film, the overall execution falls short due to poor direction, subpar dialogue delivery, and other noticeable shortcomings.The plot of Chaudhry is a strong suit, weaving together an engaging narrative that keeps viewers hooked. The storyline unfolds smoothly, offering a blend of suspense, drama, and unexpected twists that add depth to the overall cinematic experience. The characters are well-developed, and the cast delivers commendable performances, injecting life into their roles.However, where the film stumbles is in its execution. The direction lacks finesse, resulting in a disjointed and uneven flow. Scenes that could have been impactful with the right direction lose their potential due to questionable choices. The pacing feels inconsistent, hindering the overall rhythm of the narrative.One of the notable drawbacks lies in the dialogue delivery, which often comes across as forced and unnatural. This aspect detracts from the emotional resonance the film attempts to convey. A more polished approach to dialogue could have elevated the overall quality of the movie.Despite its flaws, Chaudhry manages to stay afloat thanks to its compelling storyline and the efforts of a talented cast. The film&#39;s potential is evident, and with more refined direction and improved dialogue delivery, it could have been a standout production. Unfortunately, these shortcomings overshadow the positive elements, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment.In conclusion, Chaudhry is a movie that falls short of its potential. While the story and cast offer glimpses of excellence, poor direction and dialogue delivery hinder the overall impact. If you can overlook these flaws, there&#39;s a decent narrative waiting to be discovered, but for those seeking a more polished cinematic experience, Chaudhry may not fully deliver on its promises.","A Biopic for police officer Aslam Chaudhry who was killed in 2014 in a terrorist attack in Karachi, Pakistan.

McLeod instills in his protégé a love of justice and freedom from prejudice which sustains Chuck beyond the end of the film. —Mike McBain <mike@calcite.apana.org.au>",""

I am willing to bet that the reviews praising it are either friends of if not the actual people who worked on the film, because besides cinematography, it was terrible. This movie is a amalgamation of several tropes that make other movies good, essentially trying to be 3 separate movies...and fails on all fronts.The film references way better movies like &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Shinning&quot;, the director stating something along the lines of this being a love letter to the genre... nope. As a mess of a film that can not seem to figure out what it wants to be, and can not seem to keep it&#39;s own plotlines coherent or consistent. Referencing or nodding to better films does not make yours any better. Even as a student film it would be subpar. The film attempts so many potentially great things, yet somehow can not deliver.If &quot;edging&quot; was a movie, this is it. Go watch a classic horror, or a gritty crime drama. Would have rather put toothpicks under my toenails and kicked a wall than watch this again. Trash movie, garbage story, sad credit for all involved. Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t even a &quot;The Room&quot; kind of movie that is &quot;so bad its it&#39;s good&quot; and will becomes a cult classic. It&#39;s just plain bad in all aspects, besides the cinematography.If it seems like I am ranting or hating on the movie, I am. I have no skin in the game, but the fact that this is my first review in my entire life, and the only film I walked away feeling like I wasted my time...that should say something.The final scene was seemingly thrown in last second in hope&#39;s of a sequel, although fitting as it was a terrible ending.","A group of teens stumble across the story of now dead serial killer BABY BLUE and decide he'd be the perfect subject of a true crime vodcast.

Born first as Madson in Gijón, Principality of Asturias (north to Spain), in the hard times of 1978 during the Spanish Transition that followed after the death of General Franco, changed by a few months in 1980 as Metálicos and settled definitely as Ilegales in 1981, this documentary tales the history and back stage of the band and specially the life of his always polemic and controversial lead vocal and leader Jorge Martínez, as well as the different members of the band along the time, from the Spain of the 80s years dominated by the social revolution of La Movida Madrileña (The Madrilenian Scene) and the more relaxing and quiet 90s years until the entry on the 21st century. Using a lot of unpublished material of photos and videos, Martínez and his buddies review their greatest and remembered songs and albums of their carriers, at the same time that important musicians as Víctor Manuel and music producers as Jesús Ordovás between others explain not only the relevance of Ilegales in the Spanish music stage at those times and later, but too the price of the success and the consequences for the band. A bittersweet revival for the memory of a convulsed country, and by the rebellious and explosive personality of an unrepeatable name for the history of the music: Jorge Martínez. —Chockys",""

He eventually kidnaps a woman and keeps her locked up in a shack in the woods as her friends try to find her. It&#39;s very important to keep in mind that this film beat PEEPING TOM and PSYCHO into theaters by a year so this film probably deserves to be better known among movie fans. Director Hilliard is best known for directing VIOLENT MIDNIGHT and writing the cult classic THE HORROR OF PARTY BEACH so it&#39;s interesting to see such an early cash-in on the sex maniac that would become more popular a decade or two later. This film has an ultra-low budget that doesn&#39;t allow for too much on the technical side but there are a few nice moments including one sequence in front of the mirror as the killer tries to &quot;paint&quot; over his face. The low-budget nature works in some ways as it gives the film a more documentary-like feel and this certainly helps in the scenes with the killer quietly stalking the women. What doesn&#39;t work too well are the performances, which are far from bad but none of them are good enough to really carry the movie. Another problem is the screenplay that never really gets too deep so don&#39;t expect anything psychological like the future Hitchcock film. Running a brief 58-minutes there&#39;s really not too much time to dig into any real issues with the killer so everything is pretty much just skipped in order to keep the film moving. We do get some brief nudity and a rather violent scene where the killer stones a woman to death but the blood level remains at zero. This certainly isn&#39;t a good movie but fans of the genre will probably want to check it out just to see something made before Norman Bates.","Maniac kidnaps a young girl and holds her prisoner in a shack in the woods.Maniac kidnaps a young girl and holds her prisoner in a shack in the woods.",""

There are some creepy visuals but its not really a horror in the ju-on category its more about suspense and telling a story about humans and our evils to each other. It felt more realistic in many ways than most horrors because it centered more around those factors.Very interesting movie, if you read this I hope you will give it a try.","In the household of Lee Gyeong-jin, a high-ranking official of Joseon Kingdom, three sons die from an unidentified horror.

Doesn&#39;t work to have the director being the writer. The whole thing was flat. That is the easiest way I could describe it. The music did not match the would be tension of the scenes. I kept watching in the hope it would improve. Unfortunately it did not happen. It looked like a very low budget movie with a group of actors that maybe hadn&#39;t worked in a long time. The set itself looked as if it was filmed in a studio, no real rough terrain as you would find in Iraq. Also the actors and their uniforms/clothes remained spotless all the way through, which considering they were supposed to be operating in a dirty dusty environment, was laughable.","During a military raid to rescue in Iraq, Max Forrester's teammate and girlfriend Sasha, disappears mysteriously.

Featuring hints of romance, comedy and drama, director Greene uses many of his best talents in order to make something unique and interesting. In a world where romantic comedies have been relegated to the very bottom spectrum of quality cinema, Love Evaluated doesn&#39;t so much as shatter the mold as present something with at least a dash of sincerity, It shows a way to present this sort of story while engaging the audience, rather than simply aiming for the lowest common denominator.Jayden Banks (Larry Greene) is a relationship counselor extraordinaire. Featured on television in a series of comical commercials, he has proved quite successful within his career. Unfortunately, his own love life hasn&#39;t been quite as successful as those who he has helped to counsel. When all seems to be going well in his career, Jayden realizes that something has been missing. His friends realize this as well and so he is inevitable set up on a blind date with the incredibly interesting Chelsea (Verenice Munoz), who happens to work at a Salon along with his best friend&#39;s girl. The two are immediately intrigued with one another and so they begin to date. As with any relationship though, these two will face many trials and tribulations. However, if it is meant to be, love will find a way.As with Dark Shields, I must once again commend Greene for choosing a rather stellar cast of regulars within his productions. While the screen time is certainly a bit more focused on the Jayden Banks character instead of being a more ensemble piece, many cast members from Dark Shields do regularly show up and deliver very strong performances. Greene himself slips more comfortably into the shoes of the more gentlemanly Jayden Banks and the charisma he has along with his cast makes him a perfect leader on the set. Verenice Munoz who stars opposite him is a versatile young actress who seems to slip perfectly between the more comedic aspects of the story and the intense drama that comes around for her character. Made only one year after Dark Shields, we find that Love Evaluated sees Larry Green developing much further as an artist. From the performances to the visual quality of the film, in almost all technical facets this is a large step up for the director. The film uses a very unique and deep contrast for the general visual presentation of the movie. The end result is something that looks very polished, and even organic in many ways. The compilation of characters and the individual stories that they tell, along with all of the separated drama (such as the bits and pieces revolving around one girl making trouble at the beauty parlor, or the scenes dealing with Chelsea&#39;s ex-boyfriend) seems to play into Greene&#39;s strongest attributes as a director. He&#39;s a filmmaker that does well when dealing with this high drama, without delving into the hysterics of melodrama.While it isn&#39;t a title that will blow you right out the door and into the front lawn due to its originality, it does prove to be a strong exercise for an increasingly accomplished cast and crew. If available in your proximity, it&#39;s a strong independent drama with a talented cast and some well written characters. Check it out.

This movie kept me awake because I was angry. This movie annoyed me so much that it inspired me to write my first review.First of all, I&#39;m not going to blame the actors. They should have never agreed to make this movie, and their agents probably aren&#39;t the brightest, but I don&#39;t think any amount of good acting could have made this movie any less terrible. Everything about this script should have landed it in the garbage.The plot is seemingly interesting. The premise of the movie is somewhat attractive. The first few scenes made me want to give it a chance. About 1/3 of the way through the movie, I was faced with a decision. I knew finishing this movie was going to be a grotesque waste of time, but part of me wanted to see just how bad it could get. It got inexplicably worse.My theory about how this got released (or even made it to post production) is that whoever wrote the script is the child of a major Hollywood player. It&#39;s like some A-lister&#39;s 15 yr old child was given all the resources to make a movie. The plot twists will make you cringe harder than ever before. This script would have gotten a failing grade in a high-school level writing class.In closing, I think interrogation experts should put this movie in their torture arsenal. 24 hours of this movie would be far more effective than waterboarding.","After the funeral of Mary's husband she is visited by his mother and brother, whom she'd never met before.

Actually I&#39;d call it &#39;the best&#39; but some would accuse me of exaggerating but trust me it is much better than artificial and unrealistic examples of Spanish, French and Italian romance cinema. This film has a heart inside that pumps blood to every sequence of it. I think Faith Akin did a great job keeping this film organic and earthly.There is despair, hope, love then despair and hope once again. I could easily relate to the characters. Speaking of characters, Birol Ünel is the most charismatic actor I&#39;ve seen lately, he dominates the screen along with Sibel Kekilli. Sibel Kekilli is an angel, pure acting, it is unfortunate what she had to go through in real life but she is stronger than most people and she had to prove it many times. In supporting roles there is Güven Kirac, who is one of my favorite actors in Turkish cinema and Meltem Cumbul who provides good acting.By the way despite of all the tragedy there is also ethnic humor in this film which goes hand-in-hand with the story. Especially the scenes with Birol Ünel and Guven Kirac are quite amusing, especially if you know Turkish.Anyway, all I have to say is &quot;I feel you, your sun it shines, I feel you within my mind, You take me there, You take me where the kingdom comes, You take me to and lead me through Babylon&quot; ... I was riding in that car with Cahit.Tebrikler Faith Akin, WE WANT MORE OF THESE!","In 'Gegen die Wand' Cahit, a 40-something male from Mersin in Turkey has removed everything Turkish from his life. He has become an alcoholic drug addict and at the start of the movie wants to end it all. Sibel a 20-something female from Hamburg wishes to please her Turkish parents yet yearns for freedom. She has had her nose broken by her brother for being seen holding hands with a boy and yet she can not break her mother's heart and run away. She too attempts suicide and she first approaches Cahit there at the Hospital. Sibel asks Cahit to marry her, as she believes this to be the way out of her parent's house. She promises Cahit that their relationship will be like roommates, not like a married couple. The film follows Sibel and Cahit as they get married, become closer and eventually fall in love. —Serena P.In 'Gegen die Wand' Cahit, a 40-something male from Mersin in Turkey has removed everything Turkish from his life.

It seems like only yesterday that we took the family* from our Southside palatial estate, North to Wrigleyville and The Music Box Theatre. The old Movie House on Southport Avenue is beautifully restored, appearing just about exactly as it must have in the 1920&#39;s, when it opened.This was a great way to view the Film (or should it be Films, plural?). Of all the four Family, it was probably the Daddy (Yours Truly) was the one most familiar with Puppetoons. And my own experience with them was very limited, being an occasional sighting on a local TV Kids&#39; Lunch Time Show, or some such similar viewing.THE PUPPETOON MOVIE (1987) is obviously as much a &#39;Labor of Love as a commercial movie venture. It was only out in the Theatrical Movie Circuit in a limited release. One would have to look for it at a Revival House or &quot;Art Theatre&quot;. It certainly wasn&#39;t showing at any Shopping Mall Multi-Plex, that&#39;s for sure.OUR STORY (if there is one).We open up in a Forest Primeval-type setting, where a little Bambi-like fawn is suddenly confronted by a huge Mesozoic Era Tyrannosaurus who is closing in on the little, Cenozoic Era Mammal. The little Deer starts shaking in obvious terror. As the Great, Carnivorous Reptilian Predator moves in for &quot;the Kill&quot;, he lets out with an extremely feeble excuse for a roar, and his dentures fall out!From behind the area of the Camera&#39;s eye, we hear a high pitched; &quot;Cut! Cut!&quot; which we know is the command of a Film Director. But this voice seems to be one that is familiar to the kids, as well as their folks. Suddenly, the camera gives us a full view of the green face and body of none other than Gumby!All of this leads us to a sort of explanation of George Pal, who he was and all about his work. There are all sorts of Copyright Commercial Spokesman characters and characters from films that used that Stop Action animation process. We quickly recognize Mr. Peanut (Planters Peanuts), Speedy Alka-Selszer (Alka-Selzer, Miles Laboratories), Mercury (FTD Floral) and a creature of the same name from GREMLINS; among other various assorted such similar types.Then they go into the showing of some original George Pal PUPPETOONS, which much to the credit of Writer &amp; Director Arnold Leibovit. The films are all shown from the opening credits on, sans the Logo and credits of the original releasing movie studio; which in this particular case would be (and is) Paramount Pictures Corporation.Among the multitude of Puppetoon Shorts exhibited, among our favourites were: 1. TULIPS SHALL GROW! (1942).....a story with figures in Dutch Costuming in a Peaceful Land, growing Tulips until the Mechanical Screw-Ball War machine invades them 2. JASPER&#39;S IN A JAM (1946).....Mr. Pal&#39;s Puppetoon Star, Jasper (a Black Kid )Recurring character is trapped in the Pawn Shop, thinking the Pawn Shop Keeper to be dead! It features Charlie Barnett&#39;s Orchestra with Vocalist MissPeggy Lee.3. JOHN HENRY AND THE INKY-POO (1946) Featuring the voice of Character Actor Rex Ingram.4. TUBBY THE TUBA (1947) Narrated by Hollywood Tough Guy, Victor Jory! There were so many items that we found to be most amusing, funny and of the highest order of a film can hold. One, of which the title escapes me, featured a weather barometric indicator with two doll figures, male and female; being named Punchy &amp; Judy, respectively. Damn, if that Judy character didn&#39;t look like our Daughter Jennifer!THE PUPPETOON MOVIE is available in DVD as well as the VHS. And it would certainly make a fine addition to any home video library; being a fine companion film to your Disney titles. (That&#39;s Highly Recommended there, Schultz!)NOTE: * The whole family means daughters, Jennifer and Michelle, the young Mommy, Deanna and yours truly, Daddy Ryan","Salute to the revolutionary Oscar winning stop motion animated Puppetoons created by sci-fi fantasy film legend George Pal.

One of their members is due to be executed, but the London branch of the group have kidnapped the adult daughter of the President (in London) and they will kill her if the execution goes ahead. An American commercial pilot is unwittingly used by the group to dump a packing case in the sea from a plane, to generate public attention to the issue. The police accuse him of knowingly being involved with them, but this is obviously a false trail. The London group think he may be useful to them, and he too is abducted and taken to the headquarters of the group in London; the girl is being held there too. The President is informed about his daughter's situation, but if he cancels the execution to save his daughter, his political credibility will be lost, and the Republic will fall into anarchy, and he is resolute. The group try to get the girl to appeal to her father, and when she refuses, they try to get the American to coerce her into doing so. This fails too, but the two of them are being held together in the same room, so they can support one another. The American tries sending messages on slips of paper dropped into the street, but no-one realises what they are.

Both movies were helmed by director Gary Graver.While TRINITY BROWN was an earnest effort to make a XXX hardcore detective drama, ROOTS OF EVIL started at the other end, sleazing-down the gritty, L.A. cop story. The plot and characters are mostly the same, just a slicker re-telling the second time around.Jewel Shepard is hilarious as the near-sighted stripper who can&#39;t recognize the killer. Delia Sheppard gets back to her own (real) roots as a nude dancer. Brinke Stevens as (what else?) a B-movie queen and older rich bitch Deanna Lund set up a few surprises.The plot twist at the end of ROOTS OF EVIL is the more effective of the two because it is more shocking.If you see one, you should see the other, if for nothing else, Gary Graver&#39;s maturing as a director.

The animation is done in an elegant and beautifully-coloured style, one of the better-looking Pepe cartoons for me. The music is full of character and has a wonderful sense of irony and lush affection that suits Pepe and Looney Tunes cartoons so well. The writing has wit and that delicious self-irony that is an essential part of Pepe&#39;s character. The gags are just as clever and well timed, the ending is particularly great.

Still get much enjoyment out of them now as a young adult, even if there are more interesting in personality cartoon characters and better overall cartoons.That is in no way knocking Woody, because many of his cartoons are a lot of fun to watch (almost all of them being in his prime era of the 1940s through to the mid-50s) and more and also still like him a lot as a character. For a 60s Woody Woodpecker cartoon, especially from the late 60s and directed with Paul J. Smith, &#39;Tumble Weed Greed&#39; turned out to be better than expected. There are far better Woody Woodpecker cartoons certainly, but to have a halfway decent mid-late-60s Smith-directed Woody Woodpecker cartoon was really refreshing seeing as many at this point were less than average and mostly actually very weak.It&#39;s not a perfect cartoon by all means. The animation is not great at all, or even good. Time and budget constraints shows in a lot of the animation, which is very rushed looking in the drawing and detail wise it&#39;s on the simplistic and careless side like many of Woody&#39;s cartoons from this period continuing through to the 60s.Gags-wise, mostly they are funnier and better timed than most of the cartoons from this period but there is a lack of variety and a few are not as well-timed. The story is very thin and although with a few more surprising touches than most cartoons from this era it&#39;s sometimes derivative.However, Woody is portrayed with a lot of energy and charisma and he is not as toned down as he tended to be from the late 50s onward. With this being said, he has had much more manic energy, especially in his glory days when there was far more risk-taking, and his material is still a bit too safe.Buzz Buzzard makes his first appearance since 1955&#39;s &#39;Bunco Busters&#39; and he is one of Woody&#39;s better foils by far in any of his 60s efforts. He was also one of the most frequent and earliest ones in Woody&#39;s prime era and he hasn&#39;t lost what was so good about him as a character. He is both formidable and entertaining with an individual personality and his chemistry with Woody sparkles just as much in their earlier outings.&#39;Tumble Weed Greed&#39; for a late 60s Smith-directed cartoon actually has some amusing if never hilarious moments and the havoc is entertaining to watch. The pace is surprisingly lively and has more of the frenetic energy one expects from Woody Woodpecker that was generally missing in this particular period.Further standouts are the music and the voice acting. The music is bouncy, energetic and very lushly orchestrated, not only synchronising and fitting with the action very well but enhancing it. The voice acting is typically solid.In conclusion, not great by any stretch but decent for a late Paul J. Smith-directed Woody Woodpecker cartoon. 6/10 Bethany Cox","Woody wins a car, a trip to the West, and $1,000 on a game show.

One of these purely intuitive, instinctive selections that turn out to be pretty rewarding in the end... I was much intrigued by the capsule on Netflix which went by something like &quot;while doing field work near a small port on the Ireland coast, a young geologist from Newfoundland becomes enamored of a serene, innocent local girl who has a strong personal relation with God&quot;. I&#39;m paraphrasing here but that was basically the only introductory note. I found it rather exotic and enough out of the beaten path to capture my insatiable curiosity.And God did I have a good idea today! Because compared to the truckloads of manure that are shipped from the big studios every year, this was so extraordinarily refreshing and so powerful despite its modest means. It&#39;s the best demonstration that one does need only truth and truthfulness to make a film interesting, provided that you come up with an original setup. Sometimes, hundreds of millions are spent with good purpose and a mega-production may live up to its promises and need the investment made simply because of the cost required to make unique and perfectly credible illusions. The best example is 2001: A Space Odyssey, which remains to this day my number 1 movie of all times. But next to a 2001, films such as &quot;Love and Savagery&quot;, with a ridiculously low budget, no-name yet excellent actors, and intrinsically gorgeous scenery manage to grasp a viewer&#39;s attention and imagination and leave a durable impression on him/her.I will not unveil anything of the story except the premises: Michael, a young Newfoundlander gets acquainted with Cathleen - played by Sarah Greene, a young Irish actress and a name to remember- a pretty girl working in a pub and who plans to enter the local convent and become a nun. Michael learns about her career plans almost right from the beginning, and the film describes the evolution of his ardent, devoted courtship in an environment increasingly hostile to him for several reasons. And I&#39;ll stop here. The rest is for everyone to discover for oneself.Let&#39;s say that this is about the mystery of Love when boy meets girl and an earthquake follows in both individuals. I&#39;m using the capital &quot;L&quot; not because God is at the center of the intrigue, but simply to indicate that the movie is about the universal value of the word, i.e. physical love (the sexual aspect of love) as well as love as the cement that transcends all differences and that can overcome all hardships and abolish all wars, the love of serious hippies.... Hence my use of Love. The movie is about that Love as lived by two individuals who have to cope with its far-reaching implications.My review would be incomplete if I forgot to give a special mention about the splendid role of Cathleen. Sarah Greene&#39;s expression and acting perspires the sort of purity, of virginal candor that would be expected from her vocation, and yet, she also shows great strength, the same solidity that we see in the intriguing, unique limestone formations studied by Michael around her small Irish hometown. I am looking forward to see more of her. She is absolutely mesmerizing as an actress, and she has both true external and internal beauty by standards of her own. She has a gorgeous face that does not fit with the usual Hollywoodian or Cannesian canons, but is more comparable to these actresses who look serious while taking your breath away, e.g. Lisa McAllister, Susie Parker, etc. Entirely believable in her role in Love &amp; Savagery, and the film works largely because of this. A key element to why this is a pure gem.A magnificent pearl from the rugged coastlines of Newfoundland and Ireland, and how Love will bridge the wide ocean that separates these two regions. Do yourself a big favor today and watch this film.","Love and Savagery is a story of passion, fate, and the consequences of the two.

This lady is apparently the EXACT double for a German spy and they want her to take her place!! The idea of two identical strangers who are spies is ludicrous---the idea that Lane could approximate a Russian or German accent is even more ludicrous! In fact, throughout the film, it&#39;s like accent goulash---with weird accents that are just not right or just plain old American accents with no attempt to even approximate the real thing. It comes off as cheap....and is made much worse by dialog that, frankly, sounds like it was written by a couple of 10 year- olds! So what IS Vera supposed to do and where does the film go? Well, who cares...it&#39;s never believable or interesting...though she is assisted by an American on the run who pretends, briefly, to be French...about as French as Chop Suey! Again and again, I keep thinking &quot;how could this get any stupider???&quot;...and yet it does! A terrible film with little to recommend it except as either a lesson to filmmakers about what NOT to do or else a film you can enjoy for laughs. By the way, in the opening scene, a soldier walks by some Russian office...and the soldier is wearing a WWI German helmet!!!

Cheeky may be the closest I can come up with because Sonny and Cher play on their pop personas, dress to the nines in mod 60s style, and introduce what would be the skits that would make up the bulk of their variety show of the mid 70s.There isn&#39;t much a plot to speak of, except that Sonny and Cher are asked to come up with a movie and Sonny fantasizes of the myriad ways he could reconfigure established genres and make them successful. Spoofs of note are the ones targeting THE MALTESE FALCON (film noir). Other genres made fun of are the Western and the adventure film. George Sanders plays up his stiff persona to play their boss Mr Mordicus and Sonny&#39;s heavy/villain in the skits. And yes, that&#39;s William Friedkin, some time before THE EXORCIST, making a cute little film that seems to have been aimed at the teeny-boppers, much like many of the teeny-bopper films promoting the likes of (insert teen idol here) in a fluffy movie about nothing spectacular.","Done in a similar style to the musical duo's TV show ""The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour"", this film is more a series of unconnected skits and parodies than a single running plot. When Sonny gets offered a role in a movie, he talks Cher into giving it a try. The proposed script, however, turns out to be awful, but in order to get out of doing this stinker of a project, Sonny has just ten days to come with his own better script.

She wrote articles for The Nation indicting the injustices that thrived in the United States. Indeed, Eleanor was more ambitious about establishing the social programs than Franklin was.

The young girl Emma clearly feels the separation and the loss of her father.  For the most part of the film she plays up to spoil things between her father and Liz, however she also asks questions, seeking reassurances.  It is a moving part of the film where her father cannot open his mouth to give her comfort that last longer than that evening.The plot is simple but effective and it presents a common problem well. The direction uses the sets well and it has a lived in feel to the house, using each room well to create a more sterile feel in some scenes (the father and Liz in the kitchen) or a warmer cosier feel (the father and daughter in the front room).The cast do well on the whole.  Angelou makes it seem effortless by playing up and looking like she&#39;s having fun but at the same time she manages to be vulnerable when required.  Morrissey is good and his inability to break bad news or to be honest is very real.  Ford is OK but has little to do in the third role.Overall a well made little short.  On the first viewing it may be plot light and not really go anywhere but, as a snapshot of a common father/daughter relationship it is well played and involving.","A man is getting ready for his girlfriend to come over while he waits for his young daughter's mum to come and collect her.

It is so wonderful.Sanditon is a beautifully written story of a sweet, opinionated, farm girl who travels to a new city.The acting is unmatched. The costumes are perfect representation of the day and class.I am obsessed.At this time in the world, we all need to escape to Sadition 💜","The 2 hour film (part of a larger work) takes up the story from where Austen left it, and addresses the issue of what Sir Edward Denham (Pete Ashmore) and Clara Brereton (Lucy-Jane Quinlan) would have done about their clandestine assignation being discovered by Charlotte Heywood (Amy Burrows).

It was not a religious camp and discipline was merely the bare minimum necessary to keep campers from drowning each other in the lake. It was pretty casual.The summer camp shown in Camp Stories, on the other hand -- if writer/director Biegel is to be believed -- was more akin to eight weeks spent at a Young Communist camp in the Soviet Union: a maniacal head counsellor on a power trip, an Orthodox Jewish camp owner who thinks rock and roll is obscene, religious rules that kept boys and girls on opposite sides on the camp, the slightest infraction punished by dangerous physical torture -- and a sign posted near the mail room promising campers that any mail complaining to their parents would be censored.As I said, the actual summer camp this movie was filmed at was nothing like that.But as a small independent film, this picture wasn&#39;t bad. I thought the acting was good throughout, the writing and directing more than competent, and good use was made of the locations.The story is a not-untypical story of minor teenage rebellion against the artificially repressive sexual code of the 1950&#39;s -- or at least how the Baby Boom campers remember it. It&#39;s a boy-meets-girl-on-the-other-side-of-the-tracks story, a sexy-wife-cheats-on-her-anal-retentive husband story, and a religious-culture-meets-the-outside-world story. The Orthodox Jews portrayed in this movie are only one step less out-of-touch than the Amish portrayed in Witness -- in other words, clueless. And, of course, any healthy teenager without salt peter in the food is not going to take to this sort of religious repression without a fight.Technically -- for writing, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, and musical score -- I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. It definitely should find, even at this late date, distribution on video and DVD, and deserves to be seen on the premium cable networks and late-night TV. It&#39;s a natural for the Independent Film Channel and the Sundance Channel. With a cast including Jerry Stiller, Elliot Gould, Talia Shire, Paul Sand, and Jason Biggs, it&#39;s surprising to me that this picture hasn&#39;t found a home.","A man named David Katz remembers the formative summer he spent as a kid in an Orthodox Jewish summer camp.A man named David Katz remembers the formative summer he spent as a kid in an Orthodox Jewish summer camp.",""

Paul Walker gave an excellent performance and you really got into his skin. The supporting cast was excellent, development of the characters rolled out in a believable manner with out a bunch of unnecessary revelations. I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.

It&#39;s a small scale setting that examines the relationships between a close group of friends in a truthful and honest way.The acting is really spot on and the scenes come across as very natural, which I friggin&#39; love.

Nick plans for another accident but Rogers fools him in a neat twist.Co-stars include Helen Ware as the &quot;all-seeing&quot; fortune teller, Edna West as the boarding house lady, Irving Bacon as Slim, Oscar Apfel as the circus manager, and Nestor Aber as the younger brother.The trapeze shots are quite good. Worth seeing for Jean Arthur and Buddy Rogers.","Nick, the ""swing"" man in a trapeze troupe, loves Greta Nelson, the girl in the act; and Tony, the ""flyer,"" incurs his enmity as Greta seems to favor him; thus Nick fails to catch Tony, and Tony is killed. Ned Lee, a novice, reports for the next engagement. Meanwhile, Greta discovers that Nick purposely dropped Tony, and, frightened, she seeks refuge with Ned, with whom she falls in love. Greta remains with the act to protect Ned, and when the jealous Nick plots to kill him in a similar manner, Ned swings past him and hangs by his feet. After the show, a fight results in Nick's dismissal and the reunion of the lovers.Nick, the ""swing"" man in a trapeze troupe, loves Greta Nelson, the girl in the act; and Tony, the ""flyer,"" incurs his enmity as Greta seems to favor him; thus Nick fails to catch Tony, and Tony is killed.

You&#39;ll be holding to your chair and crave for the safety of your favorite TV soap.To call it a political thriller is not doing justice to the emotional overtone of the story of Marie and her husband Alexey. Director&#39;s rendition of the Marie&#39;s courage hidden in the simplest acts is quite dazzling. That, and good acting is the major &quot;special effect&quot; of this film, theme of which cannot be dismissed as a history to be forgotten. A system similar to the Soviet communism may sprout in any country, and the fate of the condemned people may depend on the valour of both insiders and the citizen of the free world.Don&#39;t worry, the movie is not moralizing.

Every scene has the feeling of that authenticity that only films during or shortly after WW2 have. This film has understated British sensibilities, not overblown Hollywood production values. In many ways, it is similar to the one of best films of WW2, Brief Encounter. Howard was in that film as well. These were the best two films of his career; and this film is the best performance in Anna Neagle&#39;s career as well. Peter Ustinov gives a pleasing performance, and will become the owner of Spartacus in ten years or so. The only criticism of the film is the survival rate of leaders in the French Resistance. A documentary I have seen recently mentioned that the fatality rate of leaders in the French Resistance approached 75%. Hollywood (and Britain for that matter) likes to portray the Germans as stupid and incompetent when policing the French Resistance. Nothing could be further from the truth. The semi documentary I saw (Army of Shadows 1969) showed a highly efficient German surveillance of French Underground activity and the elimination of the vast majority of those brave participants. See these films for the best about the French Resistance.","This is the story of a brave woman who volunteered to join S.O.E. (Special Operations Executive) during World War II.

I&#39;ll just go over this step by step.1- Story Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst story ever. Its absolutely ridiculous, yet somehow it is probably one of the better parts of the movie.2-Directing The directing is probably the worst part of the movie, I don&#39;t know how any person could put so much filler and actionless situations in a movie.3-Editing Wow. That is the only word to describe the editing or lack thereof. People will be standing one moment, and sitting the next. They didn&#39;t even bother making clips look similar, the movie is not smooth at all. I couldn&#39;t tell if the actors were purposely repeating this over and over, or if the editing was just so bad they forgot to take out the second line.4-Acting The acting is one of a kind. In this case, that is not a good thing. The acting is extremely forced, especially in the case of Torgo. All of the actors are incredibly phony. Torgo&#39;s repetition of his lines, the delayed reactions, and Torgo&#39;s drunk motions are simply awful. I swear at times I thought the actors were mentally retarded.When you put all of these together, and add a master with a weird cape and a black dog, you get the worst movie of all time. Its so bad you really must see it to appreciate it.","A family is driving across the country when they stumble across a mysterious house inhabited by the satyr-man Torgo.

They then notice that the cool guy in town has left his keys in his car so they decide to take it for a joy ride. After picking up a couple ladies they head out for some fun but that doesn&#39;t last long.The educational film genre was pretty much dying down during the 1970s but this one here managed to get out there and it turned out to be a fairly entertaining one. The film has some weak performances as you&#39;d expect but I thought the film did an excellent job at making you like the characters and having fun with what they were doing. The film perfectly sets you up for what you know is going to happen at the end but if you enjoy these educational scare films then this one here is worth watching.","This cautionary tale, based on a real-life incident, was aimed to depict the dangers of teen-aged joy riding. Val and Tim are two bored teen-aged boys who decide they need a car to pick up girls. As they scoff at an older teen-ager named Randy, the two boys make good on their plan to steal his car (Randy had left the keys in the ignition). Val and Tim invite two female friends named Kari and Vicki along on their joy ride to a wooded area just outside of town. The foursome lose track of time and realize they need to get the car back before Randy has it reported stolen. An unlicensed Val speeds and drives recklessly, and is quickly pursued by a highway patrolman. Ignoring his passengers' pleas to pull over (or at least slow down), Val loses control of the car and - in a struggle between Val and Kari - collides head-on with side of a cliff. The post-script reveals the grim aftermath: Val, Tim and Kari are killed in the crash, and Vicki is rendered paralyzed. —Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>This cautionary tale, based on a real-life incident, was aimed to depict the dangers of teen-aged joy riding.

Mari Iyagi is one, bright, shining attempt to show the originality and amazing work that Korean animators are capable of.  It&#39;s a lone gun in the ambitiousness of such a project, and sadly, due to it&#39;s disappointing box office figures, may be for a long time.To describe the visual style of the film, I can only say to take a little touch of Samurai Jack, a heaping helping of Myazaki, and a dash of Waking life (minus the lack of fluidity in animation and pretentiousness of story) to flavor.  Then realize that doesn&#39;t begin to describe the unique look of this film, that can&#39;t be classified as traditional, digital, or 3d.  It&#39;s a remarkable blend of Flash, Traditional, rotoscoping, and 3D Studio Max that captures both realistic environments and fantasy worlds like none other. The story builds up nicely, until it reaches the end and never goes anywhere, but for all the times it made me laugh out loud, feel for a character, or gape in awe, I forgave it.It&#39;s not looking as though this film will get much of a release outside Korea, but if you ever get the chance to see it, don&#39;t let it slip by.","Kim Nam-woo struggles through life as people around him constantly leave him; his best friend, Jun-ho, is going to study in Seoul and in some ways his widowed mother is ""leaving"" him too by paying more attention to her new boyfriend.

The background music score is OUTSTANDING! The acting, cinematography, SFX are professionally done.The plot of the film is based on demonic possession. However this film differs from most exorcism films in the fact that in this film, the person himself performs a satanic rite that allows her body to be possessed.Plot: Emma Hawkins finds herself doing uncontrollable acts. She often faints and goes into seizures. Her parents are concerned and she is taken to see some specialists. However they find nothing wrong with her. Later on she has a seizure in front of her family in which she levitates.So Emma calls in the help of her uncle who is a priest to drive out the evil spirits. Watch this film to see what happens next!Verdict: this film is in a class of its own. If you enjoyed the Exorcist series of films, than this one is for you. If you decide to buy it, it will make a worthy addition to your DVD collection.P.S. Doug Bradley(role of Pinhead in Hellraiser series of horror films) makes a cameo at the end of the film!","Fifteen year-old Emma Evans has an argument with her mother Lucy since she wants to go to a concert in London with her friends Rose and Alex. Emma immediately has a convulsion and her family takes her to the hospital, but the doctors do not find any physical problem. Then her father John tries to convince his wife to send Emma to school, instead of homeschooling, but she prefers to keep Emma in the family-based education. Lucy sends her daughter to the psychoanalyst believing that she has psychological problems and Emma asks her friend Rose to record her session of hypnosis though the cellular but the doctor dies during the session. When Emma listens to the tape, she believes she is possessed by the devil and asks her parents to be submitted to an exorcism with her uncle, Priest Christopher Taylor. However her skeptical mother is against the ritual and recalls that Chris was responsible for the death of a teenager, Ana, in the past in an unsuccessful exorcism. But when Emma levitates in the kitchen in front of her family, her parents call Chris. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","$1,800,000.00"

Dylan Moran (who I thought was just going to bug me) was excellent. As was Mr Gambon and the mad Scottish hitman. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. For half of the film I was trying to remember where I&#39;d seen her before. The Parole officer. She has the most amazing smile. But clearly the true hero of this film is Mr Caine. This man should do much more comedy. This ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles (Without a Clue, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). He is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end.

"2024-01-29","Last Call at Maud's","","[""Documentary"",""History""]","From 1966 until 1989, Maud's was a San Francisco bar for women. Almost half the film sets the context leading to Maud's opening: lesbians discovering their sexual orientation and having few places to socialize; the foundation of the Daughters of Bilitis in 1955; the need for alternatives to gay (men's) bars, subject to police raids in the 1950s.

This is one of my favorite dope smuggling films.For viewers who appreciate this type of film, it&#39;s worth checking out just for the undoubtedly authentic hash making sequences. It&#39;s a 27 year old film, therefore the production techniques, and the pace of editing are not up to modern standards. But the authenticity of the location sequences more than make up for that. The cast stars John Heard as Charlie, (recently seen as detective Makazian in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Levon Helm (the Drummer for &quot;The Band&quot;), Alberta Watson, and Jon Rhys-Davies(seen as Indy&#39;s Arab friend in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;),and Michael Ironside as &quot;The Dealer&quot;. The scenario isn&#39;t exactly what&#39;s outlined above. Charlie is an American, a former drug smuggler desperately trying to go straight. The Dealer,(Ironside), takes a friend of Charlie&#39;s hostage when a drug deal goes bad. Then forces Charlie to complete the deal, as he is the only one familiar with the overseas contacts necessary to complete the mission. Charlie has to travel to Spain, then Morocco, to meet old associates and put together a multi-hundred pound Hash deal. Of course there are problems, and double crosses involved. And you end up rooting for the smugglers to complete their run. This film is unique in the sense that, unlike all other dramatic films about this topic, the Hash manufacturing sequences are obviously the real thing, it&#39;s like watching a true life dope documentary seamlessly weaved into a dramatic film. It certainly adds to the authenticity of the film when the marijuana plants, and piles of Hashish, are not an art director&#39;s plastic vision, but the real thing.","An American tourist in Spain is forced to take part in a four million dollar drug deal, because his best friend has been kidnapped, and is being tortured by the drug kingpin who set up the operation.An American tourist in Spain is forced to take part in a four million dollar drug deal, because his best friend has been kidnapped, and is being tortured by the drug kingpin who set up the operation.","CA$6,900,000.00"

The despair of the blue-collar English, working hard to make ends meet, the idea that religion is a part of the family, and a proud father willing to do anything for his daughter feels more like a Mike Leigh film than a Loach drama, but Loach stands up and demonstrates his ability to produce amazing cinema. It is a scene we have seen many times before, a father down on his luck with his family and life does anything (sewage, bounce, and sheep stealing) to provide a brand new dress for his daughter&#39;s first Communion. He is determined to give his daughter a memory she will always cherish, but he is also determined to prove his worth to his entire family. This is where the drama and real humanity of all Loach&#39;s characters begin to shine.This didn&#39;t initially seem like a film worth watching, hesitantly I worried this would be one of those over dramatic family dramas that pulled everything out of you only to leave you bored, desensitized, and counting the final minutes - within the first ten minutes of Loach&#39;s film, I knew that I was wrong. To begin, our main protagonist, completely full of flaws, but boiling over with pride, captures your attention. Our patriarch, Bob (played delicately by Bruce Jones), is immediately recognizable and relatable. Loach gives him that blue- collar, everyman appeal that isn&#39;t sugar-coated or fabricated. The instances may seem episodic at times, but what happens to Bob is real. Add to this mix his devotion to the Catholic faith, and we have a powerfully well-rounded character that leads us in and out of difficult times. With Bob is his conscious, or voice of future, the unemployed Tommy creates this very sad world, but it isn&#39;t bleak. Jobs are found, dresses are ordered, and money is used - it is the destination with this film, not the journey. Bruce Jones&#39; ability to control each scene, whether it is getting a bitter or going door to door searching for work, he is someone that we stand proudly next to. Loach has crafted a man that screams sympathy. During every moment of this film, we root for Bob, we cheer when he finds work, and each downfall we feel as well. That is a great accomplishment as both a director and an actor if each scene can bring out such emotion.Not only is the acting Oscar worthy, but Loach&#39;s (with Jim Allen) story is outstanding. From that opening scene, he pulls you into this world that feels real, that seems plausible, that demonstrates the struggle without being vulgar or gross. It is a normal town, these are trying times, Bob wants to provide for his family, and what he goes through to accomplish this is breathtaking. As Loach introduces religion into this story, a very vital element to this film, it seems only natural that when in trouble, when you feel like you can turn to nobody, the Church is there, God is there, your local priest is there to talk you through the trouble. It isn&#39;t overbearing, it isn&#39;t preachy, it is a way of life for these characters and Loach doesn&#39;t force this down our throats. It is again, this feeling of realism that makes &quot;Raining Stones&quot; stand above other films of this nature. If there were a complaint about this film, it would be the sense of timing with Bob. In one moment he has no money, in another he is suddenly debt ridden. It happens rather quickly in a 90-minute film. Also, would a man with no money to his name really spend that much on beer during the week - wouldn&#39;t he save it? Or was this Loach&#39;s commentary on the blue-collar worker? Never enough money for things that count, but plenty of time for beer and religion. An odd twist...Overall, this was an impressive film from the beginning all the way to the final moment that put this smile on your face. It was dramatic, it was grounded, and it was passionate for all the right reasons. Loach has proved himself as a director with &quot;Raining Stones&quot;, and this is a perfect example of a &quot;don&#39;t judge&quot; cover. Again, this wouldn&#39;t have been a typical film for me, but what came out of the DVD player was a cinematic dinner. Everything was in place, and you were satisfied by the end. I can only recommend this film to everyone excited about a low- budget, no CGI, drama that shows humanity at its best and worst. It will make you think, make you smile, and make you understand the struggles of life.Watch this film!Grade: **** 1/2 out of *****","This Ken Loach film tells the story of a man devoted to his family and his religion. Proud, though poor, Bob wants his little girl to have a beautiful (and costly) brand-new dress for her First Communion. His stubbornness and determination get him into trouble as he turns to more and more questionable measures, in his desperation to raise the needed money.This Ken Loach film tells the story of a man devoted to his family and his religion.

Bridges—who will most likely win an Oscar for his performance (sorry, Colin Firth, it was just your bad luck to deliver your best performance in the same year)—inhabits the character of Bad Blake so thoroughly and convincingly that you forget you&#39;re watching Jeff Bridges; he truly gives life to this alcoholic but talented country singer who is searching for some joy and redemption at the end of his career. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful in a supporting role as Blake&#39;s girlfriend, and Colin Farrell is a genuine surprise as Blake&#39;s protégé, Tommy Sweet. (By the way, who the heck knew that Farrell—and Bridges, for that matter—could sing so well?) Bonus: the soundtrack is awesome. Interesting cinema synergy—Robert Duvall (still a working actor at the age of 79), who produced this film and has a small supporting role, won a Best Actor Oscar in 1984 for playing a character similar to Bad Blake in &quot;Tender Mercies.&quot;","Bad Blake is a broken-down, hard-living country music singer who's had way too many marriages, far too many years on the road and one too many drinks way too many times.

There isn&#39;t much here for bad movie fans. There&#39;s no insane dialogue, directing, acting, etc. The problem with this movie is that it simply does nothing. Norman Foster (the director) spent way too much time filming scenes that have NOTHING to do with the story. They, literally, leave nothing to the imagination in this flick. We see endless amounts of footage of the main characters strolling around town, swimming in the ocean, drinking, eating, sleeping, performing menial tasks, driving, etc. This movie could have been a documentary of two idiotic Americans squandering their lives in the Philippines.What&#39;s the movie about? Well, ostensibly, it&#39;s about a &quot;deathhead virgin&quot; who is awakened by our Americans (whilst exploring undersea wreckage). The &quot;deathhead virgin&quot; occasionally surfaces, and occasionally murders some poor sot. In the meantime, our American divers mess around on shore, and make perfunctory dives to the previously mentioned wreckage. That&#39;s about it.Is there anything here for the bad movie fan? Unfortunately, no. Other than the aforementioned tons of useless footage/dialogue, there isn&#39;t much to sink your &quot;bad movie teeth&quot; into. Really the only highlight of this film, if you happen to be a heterosexual male, are the incredibly attractive Philippino women. Not enough to carry a bad movie (or a good movie, for that matter).Bad Movie Score: 5/10 Good Movie Score: 3.5/10","A treasure hunter finds a sunken Spanish galleon off the coast of a Philippine island.

When a new case comes in and they&#39;re short on staff, her boss has to send her out. Her first case is a doozy. When she enters the client&#39;s home, no one seems to be there, and the house is a mess. She hears scraping on a door--the old woman she is to care for is there, but in a semi-catatonic state. Soon after, she learns that there is much more wrong than bad housekeeping and a neglected old woman. There just may be threatening supernatural forces behind the scenes.This film is really the third in the Japanese Ju-On series. I won&#39;t usually watch a series out of order, but this is the only Ju-On film officially and thus easily available in the U.S. I was very anxious to watch the American remake, The Grudge (2004), and actually watched it the day before watching this film.The first 40-something minutes are closest to the American remake, but it was surprising that this film is much more linear. It&#39;s also more episodic. Neither of those facts are negative here, and both lend to a somewhat easier understanding of the broader mythology behind the Ju-On &quot;monsters&quot;, which is presented much more clearly in this film. However, the episodic nature also means that the viewer has to pay attention to the various characters and their names, or there is a good chance that one will get lost--this story touches on many different people, in many different scenarios. Occasionally, there are characters brought into each other&#39;s episodes, sometimes as subtly as a name mentioned in a news report. These cross-references, which can also slightly break the linear timeline, are effective if one is alert.There are things that writer/director Takashi Shimizu does better in this version, and things he does better in the American version. In this version, I loved the brutal opening sequence. Although it&#39;s somewhat present towards the end of the American version, it is much more effective here. I enjoyed the more traditional Japanese home--this film was shot on location in an actual house, whereas the American remake was shot on a house constructed on a soundstage. The Japanese house is more claustrophobic. On the other hand, the soundstage house was a bit grungier, which works nicely in the context of the remake. I liked this film&#39;s transition in the famous &quot;stair crawling&quot; scene (although I thought the flashbacks weren&#39;t necessary), and I also loved some of the more dissonant music here.The biggest differences occur after the first forty minutes, when Shimizu expands the number of monsters. The film seems to threaten a Romero-like plague that I&#39;d like to see explored more in other Ju-On films (if that hasn&#39;t been done already).The bottom line though is that this is a nicely atmospheric horror film, with a creepy scene per minute. There were a couple very minor flaws--occasionally awkward performances or editing being the primary one, but overall this is highly recommended. It earned a 9 out of 10 from me.","In Japan, when the volunteer social assistant Rika Nishina is assigned to visit a family, she is cursed and chased by two revengeful fiends: Kayako, a woman brutally murdered by her husband and her son Toshio.

This film is a series of vignettes of the lives of many people (22 examples shine) whose hope for a better future than that of a country undergoing disintegration on many levels were shattered. It is about &#39;little people&#39;, people with choices whose responses to the death of a hero is devastating.Racism (Christian Slater vs Laurence Fishburne vs interaction with Freddy Rodríguez and Jacob Vargas); hippie/white collar drug abuse (Ashton Kutcher dealing LSD to Brian Geraghty and Shia LaBeouf, Demi Moore&#39;s alcoholism defeating her marriage to Emilio Estevez and career as a lounge singer); aging and the problems of &#39;useless old people&#39; (Harry Belafonte and Anthony Hopkins); adultery (hotel manager William Macy married to beautician Sharon Stone yet having an affair with switchboard operator Heather Graham); marriages teetering on commercialism (Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt); young political aspirants basing futures on RFK (Joshua Jackson and Nick Cannon); and the extremes to which young men will go to avoid being sent to Vietnam (Elijah Wood and Lindsay Lohan) - these are the main characters we get to know as they prepare for the evening&#39;s party for RFK and then suffer the explosive effect of the shooting by Sirhan Sirhan (David Kobzantsev). The power of the film lies in the impact Bobby Kennedy had on all of these people who represent the rest of a nation.Estevez wisely uses film footage from life to project the speech and presence of RFK: using an actor to depict him would have made the effect less sharp. But in the end, as it seems apparent from Estevez&#39; script, the power comes from the messages in the voice-over of Kennedy&#39;s own speeches, words to offer hope and a chance for resolution of the many conflicts that threatened to destroy the US. Would that there were minds with such thoughts speaking today when a leader is so desperately needed! The film has flaws (it would be difficult for a two hour enactment of a well known yet partially fictionalized incident not to). But the message is pungent and clear: we MUST care for each other as a country and forgo the alienation that is so rampant. A very fine film for thought.

I sadly get used to this general ignorance in french film noir. Shot in 1965, it&#39;s one of the last black and white french film noir (and the last black and white Cayatte movie). It&#39;s gripping from the stressful first scenes to the scary ending, it has a strong cinematographic writing. The story is built around the three characters played by Dany Carrel. If you love Dany Carrel like I do, it&#39;s definitely her must see in these three different and opposite characters, one being close to Falconetti in &quot;Passion de Jeanne d&#39;Arc&quot; by Dreyer, and there is even Madeleine Robinson playing Jeanne Murneau, couldn&#39;t it be kind of testimony of Cayatte to Black and White? Madeleine Robinson is still great with her tense presence from &quot;une si jolie petite plage&quot; to &quot;les Louves&quot; and others. in her book &quot;l&quot;Annamite&quot;, Dany Carrel said she was glad to play these three characters and find actors she had already played with, Jean Gaven and Madeleine Robinson (often as her mother). Journalists and critics loved that movie, but the movie didn&#39;t have success in theatres, only on tv some years later.
Author Japrisot is adapted by great Jean Anouilh, so there is a large panel of dialogues for each very opposite characters.
All settings are well chosen, from italian villas to typical french garage (that have mainly disappeared today).","The young Michèle Isola, who is about to inherit a fortune from her godmother, scarcely survives a terrible fire.

You have seen the images lately as the siege in El Dorado, Texas at the other compound separated the children from their mothers who look like Laura Ingalls Wilder. First, the women are bred and born into this religion and believe what the prophet or leader has told them about the outside world. The women and children are equally suffering enough in the polygamist lifestyle while their husbands reap the benefits of a patriarchal system from another time and era. It&#39;s hard to believe that this is still going on in America but it is. As we hear about the children being ripped apart by their mothers who are as clueless in El Dorado, Texas, polygamy must be stopped more vigilantly even with the banned in the Mormon Church. The Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints or FLDS believe that all others are gentiles even Mormons. I fear another Jonestown and if gay marriage (which I support) gets legalized that it would open the door to the legalization of polygamy. Laurie Allen does a remarkable job but it&#39;s not enough. This film should have won an Oscar. It should have been more publicized. Maybe because it&#39;s in our backyard, maybe Americans want the romanticized view of polygamy like in the show, Big Love. That&#39;s Hollywood! This is real. There is abuse of all sorts here. When you hear the former wives and mothers especially Ruth Cooke who was forced into exile because she wanted to save her daughter from sexual abuse and was placed in a mental hospital. On the streets, strangers such as beggars became her unlikely support. I found it interesting that the cast is not listed here. British born Arizona State Senator Linda Bader was in for awakening. We must not forget that the women and children are born and bred into this patriarchal dictatorship in America&#39;s backyard. The members are completely brainwashed as in Waco and Jonestown. Laurie Allen has first-hand experience. I admire her courage to bring polygamy to the forefront. Documentaries don&#39;t make money unless you&#39;re Michael Moore. This documentary was a labor of love for Laurie Allen and everybody involved. It should have won an Academy Award or have been nominated. They risked their lives to get the remarkable footage of the closed insular community of Colorado City, Arizona.","A hard-hitting documentary on the largest polygamous cult in the U.S., the Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), located right on the Utah-Arizona border.

Along the way they get in major traffic jams, get kidnapped by Jesus, run into various weirdos including a cannibal group and other strangeness. As with Godard&#39;s A Woman is a Woman, this film starts off great but quickly hits a wall and really left me cold for the final half hour or so. While I was watching the second half of the film I began to get bored very quickly and I started thinking why this was the case with the director. I&#39;m not sure I came up with any positive answers but Godard kind of reminds me of sitting in the dark and having someone come up from behind you and scaring you. It&#39;s a great joke but he keeps on doing it to the point where it becomes tiresome and annoying. That&#39;s the feeling I got from watching this film because I loved and respected so much of it but after a while it just started to annoy me. The sequence where everything went wrong was the concert footage, which I thought just killed the mood and feel dead in its tracks. This was followed by an overly dramatic talk about blacks in America, which was then followed by a painfully long sequence dealing with the cannibals or whatever you want to call them. By the time the film ending I was rather frustrated but I guess this is just Godard being Godard. What I did enjoy about the film was the surreal and strange nature that everything is set up. There&#39;s a brilliantly done tracking shot, which goes on and on but never gets boring and in reality the sequence is quite beautiful. Godard, trying to be annoying on purpose, has everyone honking their horns for the entire scene and it really did come off funny as did all of the strange positions that the cars were in. Another great sequence happens early on when the wife talks about being seduced by another woman and her husband. This is a pretty erotic scene that&#39;s able to do more with dialogue than a lot of films do with actually showing the sexual acts. I like the way Godard demands that the viewer put themselves into the various situations but I think he, once again, goes overboard in his thoughts and ideas of the world.","A supposedly-idyllic weekend trip to the countryside turns into an endless nightmare of traffic jams, revolution, cannibalism, and murder as French bourgeois society starts to collapse under the weight of its own consumer preoccupations. —Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>A supposedly-idyllic weekend trip to the countryside turns into an endless nightmare of traffic jams, revolution, cannibalism, and murder as French bourgeois society starts to collapse under the weight of its own consumer preoccupations. —Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>","$250,000.00"

I loved that he played Frankie as a sweet and childish character because it worked in contrast to the &quot;grown up&quot; world around him. It was funny to see a childlike man dealing with adult situations like getting drunk. The plot was a little genetic but it was entertaining enough. I think all the actors did pretty good overall. I really liked Angell Conwell and Drew Sidora, they were great in this. The only problem I had with the movie was with some of the editing the basketball scenes made me a little bit dizzy. there was too much quick cuts and too much shaky camera. (Some of the club scenes were that way too) Also the story kind of gets lost near the end. The movie was good the first half, I actually loved the first half but once Frankie plays the game it lost some of the charm it had (It then becomes a regular sports movie. I kind of wish it was a little more sci Fi. but I think they could have done more with it. Either have more jokes and make it more funny or they could have added more to the plot, it feels like it is missing something.","Two guys who work at a morgue enlist the services of a reanimated corpse to better their chances at a streetball tournament.Two guys who work at a morgue enlist the services of a reanimated corpse to better their chances at a streetball tournament.","$1,000,000.00"

And also before he developed (at least in the two films mentioned) a clean sense of layering allegory.In this early film the sense of allegory is simplistic, and the notion of narrative is largely abandoned. All in all, this is a cleaner film. Greenaway&#39;s fulcrum is the creation of a massive clockworks kitchen with dozens of concurrent, interrelated processes. Everything revolves around this, or more precisely the vision of this. Around this center, we see both vile and sublime forces acting on the kitchen, which is a sort of metalevel over the world from which creation emanates.I suppose many will remember some of the more disturbing incidental images. Not me. I&#39;ll remember that extraordinary kitchen.","The wife of a barbaric crime boss engages in a secretive romance with a gentle bookseller between meals at her husband's restaurant.

and that role is Superman. As many comic book fans follow, the film tells the story of Clark Kent who was born on Krypton and was transported into Earth after the planet exploded and loses his real family. As a new family finds him in the field going home, the couple take Clark as their own son and raise him. What the couple know about Clark is that he has a gift to do things twice as fast than any other ordinary human being; but as time goes by, Clark loses his father of a stroke and decides to take a life of his own as he works for the Metropoltian Newspaper, he meets Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and he has a crush on her, even saving the woman from being killed. Just like any comic book movie, there is always a villain; with Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in a campy role along with Ned Beatty as Otis, the sycophant with no sense, these two plan to destroy the world with nuclear weapons. Christopher Reeve doesn&#39;t get into the Superman Costume until 45 minutes into the film in which he saves Lois in one scene, busts bad guys and becomes and icon to the public. Superman is the finest comic book movie, and I only wish Christopher Reeve&#39;s family the best.","Just before the destruction of the planet Krypton, scientist Jor-El sends his infant son Kal-El on a spaceship to Earth.

I was nine at the time and I notice the DVD has now been released with a &#39;15&#39; certificate. Oh, well. I suppose there are some scenes (helpless men shot from a boat as &#39;payback&#39; for a dead colleague, a very graphic harpooning) that are best not seen by children. In 1971 it just seemed very exciting (and had an &#39;A&#39; certificate).I enjoyed the film when I first saw it and while it seems rather dated now, I think it&#39;s still worth viewing. It sets out to provide escapist entertainment and on that level it succeeds. My memories of seeing the film 34 years ago (help!) was of the waves crashing against huge black cliffs and *feeling* the cold dampness of North-West Scotland on the edge of the Atlantic. The locations are very well used indeed, the viewer gets a real sense of place. The cast perform their roles well, Anthony Hopkins and Robert Morley particularly playing mutual antagonism with some nice comic touches.One reviewer mentioned that Charles Gray&#39;s dubbing of Jack Hawkins&#39;s voice seemed a bit slapdash. When Charles Gray was interviewed about dubbing Hawkins (which he did quite regularly after the mid-60&#39;s) he said that Hawkins insisted on *speaking* his lines even after his voice was gone. The result was to make his delivery very erratic and therefore difficult to voice-over. Jack Hawkins was one of the best actors we&#39;ve had (Cruel Sea, Bridge on the River Kwai, Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, etc., etc.) and these supporting roles made a rather sad postscript to his career.","In a vein similar to the James Bond movies, British Agent Philip Calvert (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is on a mission to determine the whereabouts of a ship that disappeared near the coast of Scotland.In a vein similar to the James Bond movies, British Agent Philip Calvert (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is on a mission to determine the whereabouts of a ship that disappeared near the coast of Scotland.",""

I do not see it as such nor do I see any write-up claiming that. This film is based on a very famous and controversial sport and 2 of the fastest climbers. It has mind blowing views from the climber&#39;s perspective as well as from the perspective of the helicopter or drone. But I do feel there could have been more of that type of footage in this film- I would have rather seen more of each climber in action. I also just want to mention that it&#39;s a little hard to keep track of who&#39;s speaking because, unlike in most films, this film fails to identify the speaker each time.It&#39;s interesting to me that mountain climbing, even free solo, is legal and can be called a sport while rooftopping, for example, is illegal and is called dangerous and suicidal. Both are big draws for media and always have been. The fact that we have social media and more opportunity now than ever to capture an event is just the nature of progress. Which brings me to my main concern about Steck&#39;s claim that he summited Eiger yet has no documentation. My first thought when the film crew stayed below and he went up was that he will have no way to document that because he doesn&#39;t have a camera crew and he&#39;s going to do it in the dark. And I wondered to myself why would anybody attempt that, especially since climbing at night is so dangerous that even most experienced climbers don&#39;t do it. So in the morning when they saw him descending and wondered out loud &#39;did he climb the summit?&#39; I wondered the same thing. And to be honest it&#39;s hard for me to say that I think he actually did it. Because if you&#39;re trying to fake something, what better way than to leave your camera crew below because it&#39;s too dangerous and then to go in the dark - and then come down and claim that you were successful. Of course you have the capability, you&#39;ve worked your adult life to become this machine so no one doubts you but should it really be a record when there&#39;s no evidence? I say no. There&#39;s an old rule since when we&#39;re children and it says that if there is no proof or no witness then it did not happen. I mean if you go to the Guinness World Book of Records and say hey a whale swallowed me and yet I lived, I was in the ocean and I was washed up on the beach and in the meantime I was in the the stomach of a whale. At the Guinness World Book of Records the guys would say &#39;well that&#39;s all well and good and congratulations but your feat needs to be recorded before it can go in the book.&#39; With every possible means at his disposal, Steck failed to document some of his most important claims and I&#39;m just not buying it. I think that when he was actually being filmed or watched is when he failed and died because he was trying to break his own record which didn&#39;t actually exist. And forgive me if you think I&#39;m speaking ill of the dead, but I&#39;m just saying what a lot of people are thinking and what his own camera crew wondered the next morning. They couldn&#39;t see him moving all night they lost track of his light, which tells me that he probably stayed in one spot turned off his light and then made the decent in the morning. I mean I&#39;m not a mountain climber but I&#39;ve watched probably every mountain climbing film that exists and I&#39;m just wondering to any mountain climber out there, or any extreme sports junkie, would you really go about setting a record without documenting it? I don&#39;t think anyone who would say yes to that question. He didn&#39;t even have a picture or audio from the very top where his phone would have documented his altitude. You don&#39;t have to have an app running on your watch for it to document your altitude. And isn&#39;t it interesting that he chose to leave his phone down at the camp , which would have automatically notated his altitude .And then the way, at the end, where they have this big question of &#39;well if you&#39;re doing it for yourself does it really need to be documented and really let&#39;s confess it&#39;s all about attention,&#39; I think what they&#39;re failing to understand is that people like Steck and Dani didn&#39;t choose the sport in order to get attention; attention chose them because of their sport. So let&#39;s get that straight. And secondly, competing, by necessity, means that you&#39;re going to compare yourself to someone else who is doing a similar sport. No one sets about doing something passionate without sharing it, whether it&#39;s with their spouse or their children or whether it&#39;s with the world. Imagine if Shakespeare had never shared his plays or if the Wright brothers had never shared their invention would we give them accolades for their humility? Give me a break.But back to my original comment, I do worry that rooftoppers are called Daredevils and tall buildings are admonished for not having enough security or gates or fences while mountain climbers and free solo artists are called Sports enthusiasts and we freely follow them in the media. I know this may sound like a tangent and I&#39;m not saying that I agree with risking your life ever but I&#39;m just honestly not sure what the difference is except that on the rooftop it&#39;s illegal and on the top of the mountain it is legal, especially if you spend a year&#39;s salary to pay all the fees. Why do we celebrate Steck&#39;s life but have multiple lawsuits and outcrys about Wu Yonging&#39;s death? Both men were doing what they love, challenging themselves and exciting the world. Were they pushed too hard by media and money? Should there be some kind of limitations set by law that tells them at this point you&#39;re still sane but at this point you&#39;re insane? I think we have too many laws in the world. It&#39;s not that I want to see people die doing extreme sports but I think they should be able to do them. We have a license to drive a 3-ton lethal weapon on the streets and despite thousands of accidents per year, many of them lethal, nobody is claiming that we should close down the streets or put more fences around them so that the wrong people don&#39;t get into them. So there&#39;s my rant and my two cents. I guess I&#39;ve given you a lot to think about and you might agree with part of what I said and not all, but thanks for reading.","Fearless alpine climbers Ueli Steck and Dani Arnold enter into a death-defying rivalry to set speed records on the Swiss Alps' great north faces.Fearless alpine climbers Ueli Steck and Dani Arnold enter into a death-defying rivalry to set speed records on the Swiss Alps' great north faces.",""

Shankar, his vision, VFX &amp; 3D: The maximum, an Indian movie has ever achieved, that is so close to the Hollywood standards. A very satisfying and convincing work, with such a limited budget (comparing with Hollywood films). Grand imaginations and an ambitious work by the director!Rajini Factor: Although Vasigaran and Good Chitti characters could not impress us much, Rajinikanth starts his rage with 2.0 and 3.0 characters. He nails them to perfection with proper entertainment value. 2.0 is the true Indian superhero, with a lot of potential future projects.Akshay Kumar: His dedication is impressive. His acting in the flashback portion is very natural and he deserves an applause for accepting that character.AR Rahman&#39;s BGM and Nirav Shah&#39;s camera work lift the movie to another level.Negative:
An underwhelming and weak storyline that is easily predictable. Screenplay is flat, without any interesting cat-and-mouse moments between the protagonist and antagonist.Given that most of the superhero films in the Hollywood too have such simple and predictable storylines, the only negative of the film can be magnanimously ignored.Go watch this indigenous product, that will definitely make you proud as an Indian!","8 years after Chitti was dismantled due to destruction he caused.

Due to a drought that has extended over many years, cattle ranching in the region is dying out, with most area residents moving out. One who has remained, John Gower (Grainger Hines), while riding near his property, comes upon a recently overturned buckboard wagon with a neighbour crushed to death beneath it and his new Brazilian mail order bride, Juliana (Vanusa Spindler), lying nearby and gravely injured.  John takes the injured woman to his house where he and his young daughter J.D. (Sabrina Chateau) tend to her injuries, and where an attachment is formed between Juliana and the motherless girl, helping to ease J.D.&#39;s loneliness.  Gower&#39;s neighbour, Colonel Howling (Ted Markland), believes that if gold were to be found in local stream beds the worth of the dwindling grazing land would be greatly increased, and he therefore employs the services of a geologist for assaying purposes, at the same time attempting to acquire as many local holdings as possible, including that of Gower.  Howling&#39;s son Adam (Robert Kotecki) decides to assist his father with the land grab, but when he substitutes violence for conventional business dealings, conflict with Gower leads to an inevitable showdown.  The storyline has interest but is betrayed by banal dialogue and uneven direction, leading to a series of raggedly conducted scenes, with awkward blocking, while only Spindler invests her role with a consistently compelling style.  The cast and crew are often used interchangeably and it is apparent that a good deal of sincere effort went into this production, marked as it is with authentically based production design and costuming in addition to exceptional cinematography, all enhanced by skillful post-production (but for some erratic editing).  Colourful to the eye and never dull, THE OUTSIDER is too often burdened by a melodramatic scenario that would have benefited from additional cutting.  However, all involved ostensibly enjoyed making the picture, many wearing several hats, e.g., Paul Freeman, who garnered FOURTEEN credits here, including one as a member of the cast and, among the others: original score, musical director, title design and sound editor; it would be difficult to give him a label, unless it were &quot;Deeply Involved&quot;.","John Gower is a widower, trying to take care of his land and his daughter, JD.

When the international company has a problem to arrive in Brazil for a season in the casino, they are hired by the manager of the casino, but the show does not work well and they have to runaway.&quot;Alô, Alô, Brasil&quot; is the oldest Brazilian spoken movie preserved in the present days. The practically inexistent story is very simple, and the movie is basically supported by twenty-two presentations of the popular Brazilian radio phonic singers along 78 minutes running time and some gags. In the period of 1930 to 1948, Brazil did not have technical and technological resources (suitable equipment, mixing table etc.), and the shootings were made in a static and fixed plane to avoid noise. The movements of the camera were made only in silent scenes. This musical is a classic, since all the important Brazilian singers of the 30s, with exception of Noel Rosa, participate of this movie. &quot;Alô, Alô, Brasil&quot; was shot also in locations and not only in studios, which was very daring for that period, based on the lack of technology in Brazil and the need of absolute silence. The movie is popular and target audience is the lower classes. Most of the songs have malicious lyrics for the moral standards of 1935. The cubist and surrealistic panels were used to hide the microphone with limited range. There are hidden and metaphoric messages, like for example, the use of a Brazilian company as the substitute for an international one, a clear message about the need to support the Brazilian cinema in that moment. The managers are small time crooks and vagabonds, and that was the image of the artistic class in those times.

When a teenaged girl turns up dead in a landfill, a homicide team is sent up from Oslo to back up the local police, who are ill-equipped to handle such a murder owing to its infrequency. Above the Arctic Circle, the lead detective is like a fish out of water - the 24-hour daylight drives him crazy and he is desperate to get out.The scenes have a cold, bare feel to them, like the shooting locations (Tromsø and environs) and the protagonist/antagonist, Jonas Engstrøm (Stellan Skarsgård). Stark is a good word - but it is effective, and also beautiful. Bjørn Floberg also turns in a solid performance as the prime suspect. I found Skarsgård&#39;s female foil (Gisken Armand) a bit cloying but that&#39;s not enough to bring the whole film down.Skarsgård&#39;s intensity is impressive and captivating, and the dynamic between his character and the others (he is Swedish, they are Norwegian) helps keep you interested. It&#39;s interesting to see how being a murder cop hardens a person - whether that person is Norwegian, Swedish, or American doesn&#39;t matter.I would definitely recommend this film. It&#39;s a powerful and beautiful work that deserves to be seen.","In a Norwegian city with a 24-hour daylight cycle, a Swedish murder investigator is brought in to find an elusive killer.

The film opens with him being released on parole after serving a year, and establishes from the outset an element of suspense in that he will have to walk away from any potential confrontation he encounters; a situation he is not temperamentally cut out for.Writer-director Lambert Hillyer does his usual workmanlike job, assisted in this instance by atmospheric photography by Byron Haskin, notably in a bank robbery staged at night after hours.","Buck Donlin is released from prison, with the condition he can't carry a firearm, after being unjustly convicted of the killing of a detective who was on the trail of a cattle thief. He returns to his hometown to find everybody against him except his sweetheart Helen Evans, her father Henry Evans and young Jimmy. Buck knows who the killer really is but faces some handicaps in proving it. Evidently, the original cast credits frames are missing from the video prints available (taken from the Gail TV prints that always scrapped the original title frames), and some source has used the Variety review of this film as their source for the cast order and role names. The only problem with that is that the review cast listing managed to eliminate Edward LeSaint (playing Henry Evans, billed as Edward J. LeSaint)and then crunched the name into that of the next player, and came up with Edwin J. Brady playing Henry Evans. Ed Brady (actually billed as Edwin Brady, the incorrect review listing aside) played bad guy ""Lefty.""This has been corrected on the IMDb site once before, and since The Gail TV prints seldom showed the character roles on Columbia westerns, including this one,it would be appreciated greatly if the contributor that ""re-corrected"" it back to the typo-laden credits shown in the January 26, 1932 review, would not do so again, especially if said contributor doesn't seem to know the difference between actors Edward LeSaint and Ed (Edwin) Brady. Or, possibly, hasn't watched the film. —Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>",""

The plot is as Z-grade as any Asian soap opera (like Australia&#39;s Neighbours, but more over-the-top), and features long-lost children, incest, lame martial arts sequences and several reprises of the one song  for some unknown reason. It&#39;s also difficult to follow the travails of the characters - although no one except for Miss Pussy really matters in this film.

He never got Rebecca&#39;s letters of information, it seems. Can the aging rocker turn his life around and become a true father to his child? And, will Olivia be able to pursue a future that makes use of her stunning voice? This is a nice film in many ways. Church is great as the teenager and her voice is beyond compare. The other actors are also quite nice, the Wales setting is beautiful, and the movie&#39;s production values are more than adequate. Most important, the message of forgiveness resounds throughout the movie, a message that is needed by everyone. If you like music, romance, and humor, and who does not, get this very fine film at some point in the near future. It is a sweet movie that will make viewers everywhere feel on top of the world.","A washed-up 80's pop star suddenly has a new direction in life when he discovers that he has a teenage daughter, Olivia, in Cardiff, Wales.

However, I somehow never got around to acquiring it  chiefly because the print included was English-dubbedthough, in retrospect, that&#39;s what the actors are speaking (with leading lady Florinda Bolkan providing her own voice). Then, just last week  coincidentally, on the very same day I acquired an even more obscure entry within the same genre (albeit of a much-filmed source i.e. THE NUN OF MONZA [1969])  I stumbled upon a copy of FLAVIA itself and, at this stage, I simply could not let the opportunity pass me by. The film&#39;s reputation for gory depictions of carnage and torture was not exaggerated but, seeing how these scenes are part and parcel of its unflinching portrayal of the Middle Ages (stunningly shot in earthen tones by Alfio Contini), they do not feel gratuitous or sensationalistic; besides, the whole comes wrapped in an evocatively beautiful soundtrack courtesy of future Oscar-winner Nicola Piovani. Bolkan, able to convey much without the benefit of dialogue, is impressive as ever: she convinces in her character&#39;s every facet (including donning a soldier&#39;s armor), and this is possibly her signature role. Maria Casares (best-known for playing Death in Jean Cocteau&#39;s ORPHEUS [1950]) is animated and uninhibited, despite her time-ravaged looks a&#39; la Alida Valli: for the record, I thought she would be playing the convent&#39;s obligatory stern Mother Superior but is actually the one to inspire Flavia towards rebellion. Claudio Cassinelli appears as a Jew befriended by the heroine, whereas Anthony Corlan (later Higgins)  of Hammer&#39;s 1972 outing VAMPIRE CIRCUS  is the young leader of the Muslim invaders (none of whom look remotely Arabic!) aiding the heroine in accomplishing her male/Christian-hating campaignuntil she rejects marriage and conversion to his own religion. While having undeniably greater significance and scope than most films of its ilk (though the expected hysterical writhing is still present in the form of a wandering sect afflicted by the bite of a tarantula!), plot development is curiously lacking here  which, coupled with the trademark deliberate pacing of the &quot;Euro-Cult&quot; style, makes for an altogether muddled (if never less than interesting) affair. An unexpected touch involves fantasy sequences showing various religious paintings come to life, often as a result of the nuns&#39; (typical) sexual repression. Naturally, we get plenty of nudity and, for violent highlights, anything from numerous beheadings, the castration of a horse(!), rape, sodomy, cannibalism, boiling oil being poured on a girl&#39;s naked body, nipple-slashing, impaling and skinning alive is the order of the day! One final thing: viewers of the Synapse edition had regretted the lack of a trailer on that disc; incidentally, a German one has been made available among the extras accompanying the X-Rated Kult R2 DVD of the afore-mentioned THE NUN OF MONZA","Italy 1400: A convent of nuns are invaded by the Tarantula Sect on their annual pilgrimage.

Not only does this film possess one of the best titles in cinematic history, it also boasts innovative direction, great gore effects and some wonderfully tasteless humour.The film is based on a simple, yet very effective premise. Two old ladies invite various family members to their large estate in order to celebrate their birthday. As the family gathers for dinner, a package arrives from a disowned cousin, which the two old grannies quickly unwrap. Inside the package is a box containing an evil spirit, which takes possession of the women and turns them into blood hungry demons. From this point on, the grannies gleefully decapitate, dismember and torture their guests with a high degree of wit and originality.Despite the obvious budgetary constraints, the gore is well done and original. Highlights include one of the grannies literally biting her rotund nephew&#39;s butt off and the scene in which the grannies lure their granddaughter to her death. All of the violence has a strong undercurrent of black humour, which thankfully is never constrained by the bounds of good taste. Examples include the fate of the cowardly priest and the throwing around of severed body parts. I highly recommend the unrated European version of the film as the Troma edition, at least in Australia, is missing a significant amount of carnage.Rabid Grannies (literally translated &quot;the cannibalistic grandmas&quot;) is an unusual and highly amusing horror film, which is destined to become a cult favourite. I think it is time for Emmanuel Kervyn to hurry up and make another picture. Rabid Grannies 2 would be a nice place to start.","When given a demonic present by their black sheep nephew two kindly old grannies are transformed into demons who proceed to gorily knock-off their greedy relatives. —Chris Hartley <hartless@stn.net>When given a demonic present by their black sheep nephew two kindly old grannies are transformed into demons who proceed to gorily knock-off their greedy relatives. —Chris Hartley <hartless@stn.net>","$150,000.00"

I am a woman, and hated this film. The bottom line, whether you are male or female, is that this movie is terrible in many ways. The failure of this film can be blamed largely on Jordana Brewster. Her Phoebe is by turns annoying, cruel, selfish, ridiculous... you name it -- Brewster is almost unwatchable in her portrayal of a difficult character. I imagine an actress with more emotional sensitivity could have pulled it off and made the character a bit sympathetic, but Brewster fails entirely. From what I understand, she is studying at Yale... let&#39;s hope she&#39;s majoring in something other than drama. Cameron Diaz fares better -- unlike Brewster, she&#39;s actually acting. But her character Faith is cursed by writer/director Adam Brooks, who robs us visually and verbally of Faith&#39;s real struggle. He has the other characters inform us that Faith is upset, rather than give Diaz the chance to really portray the conflict onscreen. And so when we finally reach the point where we learn what really happened to her character, it feels like an anticlimax. Diaz tries her best, but she can&#39;t save Faith. I&#39;m a fan of both Christopher Eccleston and Blythe Danner, and why either of them chose to appear in this movie is a mystery to me. Eccleston, like Diaz, is given little to work with -- he&#39;s reduced to a series of broody stares at Brewster and a very bad hippie wig that makes him look older, not younger. Danner, as Phoebe and Faith&#39;s mother, is limited largely by poorly written dialogue and by the fact that all of her scenes are with Brewster. Given the dramatic potential of the story, I think it could have been a better film in the hands of another writer/director, and with someone other than Brewster as the central character. As it is, Brooks has given us Brewster in an uneven, poorly-written and emotionally lacking display of moviemaking. The Invisible Circus is a waste of time.","In 1975, at age 18, Phoebe is unhappy.

immediately noticed the very bad casting, all the actors lack charisma and personality and their acting is boring if not ridiculous.The first half of the movie is just a sequence of actions with very few dialogs, so it&#39;s almost entertaining. Nothing spectacular or original. It feels like some washed out guardians of the galaxy, and we follow the heroes as they keep putting themselves in trouble. The CGI looks like a video game with some very bad green screens.But that&#39;s where the film takes another turn for the worse, and the poor writing and acting take over the action scenes. It feels like they ran out of money and decided to focus on the character psychology. The film completely loses its pace and collapses into absolute mediocrity.If you want some cheesy 60/70s sci-fi movies, watch Starcrash or Barbarella, they are better than this.","Life is an adventure for space scavengers Kip Corman and his daughter Taylor as they navigate their ship through a universe filled with monsters, aliens, and robots in order to reach the mythical Deepstar and collect the riches within.Life is an adventure for space scavengers Kip Corman and his daughter Taylor as they navigate their ship through a universe filled with monsters, aliens, and robots in order to reach the mythical Deepstar and collect the riches within.",""

A quick Google confirms that Jennings wasn&#39;t much success as a crook and that the film took lots of liberties with his story, though I couldn&#39;t determine whether the reward for his capture every topped $20,000, as shown in the film. What made his life interesting was his political career after release from prison, but I guess that wouldn&#39;t have added much to an &quot;action&quot; Western.Having fled Oklahoma because he fears being betrayed by his fellow gang members, Jennings returns to them, which didn&#39;t seem too bright. And the botched final raid on the train and its meagre rewards seem to sum up his career as a bad man. But the posse wasn&#39;t too bright, either, with its 20 or so members failing to capture the depleted Jennings gang at the ranch, though at least this led to a chase and final showdown.It was good to see a youngish John Dehner, and Guinn Williams in a role where his character wasn&#39;t too empty-headed.","The four Jennings brothers are Lawyers.

Firstly, Robinson Crusoe is my all-time favorite story, which naturally predisposed me to like this movie from the beginning. Secondly, I have a fondness for apocalyptic movies of all kinds, further adding to my initial positive bias. That being said, I found this film to be quite enjoyable. In fact, I&#39;ve already watched it three times over the past three months.However, after my most recent viewing last night, I noticed that the movie&#39;s charm has somewhat diminished. Upon reflection, I believe this feeling is largely attributed to the nostalgia associated with the movie as a whole, particularly the soundtrack, which, in my opinion, beautifully captures the essence of music from the past decade or so.While my initial predisposition due to my love for Robinson Crusoe and apocalyptic movies led me to find this film decent and enjoyable, repeated viewings have revealed certain shortcomings. Despite its appealing soundtrack and nostalgic elements, I must admit that upon closer examination, much of the story throughout this movie lacks direction and substance.","In a post apocalyptic world, two women find themselves shipwrecked and alone on a deserted island.

At many times I thought it was a gorgeous film, shot perfectly, but at others I felt uncomfortable and shocked. We are given a love story between a troubled young man and a high school girl trapped in a family that could self-destruct at any moment. These two have been on a journey to find themselves, and in each other&#39;s kindred spirits finds another to help steer them onto the right course. However, a relationship like this cannot last. Whether or not you throw in the hot-tempered father, the shy brother lacking in gumption, or the voice inside our lead&#39;s head, the tale is one ripe for tragedy. I guess that means it all hinges on the story that gets you from the beginning to the end and whether it is one that was worth the journey. Despite the numerous moments that seemed out of place, and those that stirred discomfort, I will have to conclude that the path is ultimately one I&#39;m glad I took. The great moments were a sight to behold and the tough ones did their job because I still can&#39;t shake them.If nothing else, the acting is top-notch. Evan Rachel Wood is truly amazing for a girl her age. From the little girl in Digging to China, to the rebellious teen in Thirteen, I can&#39;t believe how poised she is in all she does. Whereas someone like Anna Paquin fell off the map, as she got older, I think Wood will be around for quite awhile, and I can&#39;t wait for Across the Universe later this year. In this film, she encompasses the role of a young woman trying to break free from her stifling yet loose family life into a relationship that is too much for someone of her maturity to completely understand. When she slowly realizes what she is a part of, it is too late, and her mixture of fear with the love she still holds is heartbreaking. David Morse also brings a brilliant performance to the table. A long time character actor, he plays the formidable, sheriff type well, yet has the emotional range to portray the compassion he has underneath the rough exterior. His role is a man that is doing his best, but only when tragedy strikes does he realize how much love he has to give. Rory Culkin rounds out the supporting cast showing nice restraint in a confused young boy unable to differentiate good from bad as the good does what seems bad in order to protect and the bad puts on the façade of good to win him over.In the end, the real force of the movie is Edward Norton. It&#39;s good to see that after his little hiatus from acting, he has come back better than ever. His character Harlan is a complex man with a past that has made him regress into the age of chivalrous western ranches. You can see it in his eyes that the world wronged him in some way and he needed to become a part of a moment in time where people mattered and not material objects. When he ends up in an old west film set and watches the extras dancing and enjoying life in its bear form, the ecstatic look on his face shows it all. Harlan doesn&#39;t know who he is and the love of this very young girl puts him into a world that threatens the façade he has worked hard to build. The drugs and the selfishness and the pain wreak havoc on his mind and he begins to let his past anger rise back to the surface. Every moment as he continues on his journey is true to him; when he changes reality to suit his survival, he believes every word he is saying. Something is broken in him, and no one could have portrayed it better than Norton.I do think, though, that the acting is too good for the film. Morse and Norton are so effective in showing the dual nature of their characters that you end up feeling cheated never finding out what happened in their lives to get them to the points they are at when we are introduced to them. The script never allows us to see any of the characters&#39; motivations, only the slice of life we are shown on screen. Is Harlan the son of a Rabbi? just a troubled youth with a criminal record? both? and if so what happened to make him try and forget it all? These are questions that the movie makes you ask, but never gives any answers to. To have a beautifully shot scene of Norton and Wood out in the country with a wonderful transition sequence involving a swing-set and then at the end progress to an outlaw gunfight chase is all at once jarring and effective, and yet insufficiently explained. These characters are so complex, I just wish the film did more to help us understand them all rather than just show us what happens when their cultures clash in the game of love. Definitely worth a look, but ultimately an underachieving film that had the makings for greatness.","Tobe is about 16, living with her dad and younger brother in LA's San Fernando Valley.

If this doesn&#39;t make a great deal of sense blame the film makers not me.A film director is actually a wanted man from America. Working at the studio is another man who could be his twin. The director sensing that he is about to be found out, convinces his &quot;twin&quot; to switch places with him. The ploy is to establish himself as his &quot;twin&quot; and then bump him off allowing him to go off with out being charges. However things don&#39;t go as planned and he ends up having to contend with the events in this new life.Trust me its much more confusing than that with plot lines including blackmail, more murders, and jealousy. Even allowing for the fact that the print (from Sinister Cinema) I saw runs 55 minutes as opposed to the IMDb time of 72, this film is a real mess. The acting is okay but the plot just goes in wild circles in order to spin out to a required running time.If you want a good example of a British quota film this is it. Frankly other than the actors I don&#39;t think anyone cared about this film, all one need do is look at the opening gangster movie sequence to realize that this was viewed as a joke (and a not very funny one). Two minutes in I was ready to turn it off, of course it got better but barely.This is mostly a waste of time. If you want a movie to seriously engage you look elsewhere. If you want a film that you can view as a cryptic challenge then by all means give this one a try.","(1935) Henry Kendall, Eve Gray, Jeanne Stuart, Garry Marsh, Wally Patch.
